	abstract = {Although marine protected areas (MPAs) are a common conservation strategy, these areas are often designed with little prior knowledge of the spatial behaviour of the species they are designed to protect. Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (∼14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of ∼250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode ≈30\%). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint.},

	abstract = {1. Fishing spans all oceans and the impact on ocean predators such as sharks and rays is largely unknown. A lack of data and complicated jurisdictional issues present particular challenges for assessing and conserving high seas biodiversity. It is clear, however, that pelagic sharks and rays of the open ocean are subject to high and often unrestricted levels of mortality from bycatch and targeted fisheries for their meat and valuable fins. 2. These species exhibit a wide range of life-history characteristics, but many have relatively low productivity and consequently relatively high intrinsic vulnerability to over-exploitation. The IUCN - World Conservation Union Red List criteria were used to assess the global status of 21 oceanic pelagic shark and ray species. 3. Three-quarters (16) of these species are classified as Threatened or Near Threatened. Eleven species are globally threatened with higher risk of extinction: the giant devilray is Endangered, ten sharks are Vulnerable and a further five species are Near Threatened. Threat status depends on the interaction between the demographic resilience of the species and intensity of fisheries exploitation. 4. Most threatened species, like the shortfin mako shark, have low population increase rates and suffer high fishing mortality throughout their range. Species with a lower risk of extinction have either fast, resilient life histories (e.g. pelagic stingray) or are species with slow, less resilient life histories but subject to fisheries management (e.g. salmon shark). 5. Recommendations, including implementing and enforcing finning bans and catch limits, are made to guide effective conservation and management of these sharks and rays.},

We present data from nine C. amblyrhynchos monitored within the Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea off the coast of Australia. Shark presence and movements were monitored via an array of acoustic receivers for a period of six months in 2008. During the course of this monitoring few individuals showed fidelity to an individual reef suggesting that current protective areas have limited utility for this species. One individual undertook a large-scale movement (134 km) between the Coral Sea and Great Barrier Reef, providing the first evidence of direct linkage of C. amblyrhynchos populations between these two regions. Results indicate limited reef fidelity and evidence of large-scale movements within northern Australian waters.},

	abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management. Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of environmental condition and management and links to policy responses, key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.},

	abstract = {Due to human activities, marine and terrestrial ecosystems face a future where disturbances are predicted to occur at a frequency and severity unprecedented in the recent past. Of particular concern is the ability of systems to recover where multiple stressors act simultaneously. We examine this issue in the context of a coral reef ecosystem where increases in stressors, such as fisheries, benthic degradation, cyclones and coral bleaching, are occurring at global scales. By utilizing long-term (decadal) monitoring programs, we examined the combined effects of chronic (removal of sharks) and pulse (cyclones, bleaching) disturbances on the trophic structure of coral reef fishes at two isolated atoll systems off the coast of northwest Australia. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of sharks can have an impact that propagates down the food chain, potentially contributing to mesopredator release and altering the numbers of primary consumers. Simultaneously, we show how the effects of bottom-up processes of bleaching and cyclones appear to propagate up the food chain through herbivores, planktivores and corallivores, but do not affect carnivores. Because their presence may promote the abundance of herbivores, the removal of sharks by fishing has implications for both natural and anthropogenic disturbances involving the loss of corals, as herbivores are critical to the progress and outcome of coral recovery.},

Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state-space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

Although pathogen emergence has been linked to anthropogenic land conversion, a general framework to disentangle underlying processes is lacking. We develop a multi-host model for pathogen transmission between species inhabiting intact and converted habitat. Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion. This framework provides insights into the mechanisms driving disease emergence and spillover during land conversion. The finding that the risk of spillover is highest at intermediate levels of habitat loss provides important guidance for conservation and public health policy.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.0050218},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Envenoming resulting from snakebites is an important public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries. Few attempts have been made to quantify the burden, and recent estimates all suffer from the lack of an objective and reproducible methodology. In an attempt to provide an accurate, up-to-date estimate of the scale of the global problem, we developed a new method to estimate the disease burden due to snakebites. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The global estimates were based on regional estimates that were, in turn, derived from data available for countries within a defined region. Three main strategies were used to obtain primary data: electronic searching for publications on snakebite, extraction of relevant country-specific mortality data from databases maintained by United Nations organizations, and identification of grey literature by discussion with key informants. Countries were grouped into 21 distinct geographic regions that are as epidemiologically homogenous as possible, in line with the Global Burden of Disease 2005 study (Global Burden Project of the World Bank). Incidence rates for envenoming were extracted from publications and used to estimate the number of envenomings for individual countries; if no data were available for a particular country, the lowest incidence rate within a neighbouring country was used. Where death registration data were reliable, reported deaths from snakebite were used; in other countries, deaths were estimated on the basis of observed mortality rates and the at-risk population. We estimate that, globally, at least 421,000 envenomings and 20,000 deaths occur each year due to snakebite. These figures may be as high as 1,841,000 envenomings and 94,000 deaths. Based on the fact that envenoming occurs in about one in every four snakebites, between 1.2 million and 5.5 million snakebites could occur annually. CONCLUSIONS: Snakebites cause considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. The highest burden exists in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {Many emerging pathogens infect both domesticated and wild host species, creating the potential for pathogen transmission between domesticated and wild populations. This common situation raises the question of whether managing negative impacts of disease on a focal host population (whether domesticated, endangered, or pest) requires management of only the domesticated host, only the wild host, or both. To evaluate the roles of domesticated and wild hosts in the dynamics of shared pathogens, we developed a spatially implicit model of a pathogen transmitted by airborne spores between two host species restricted to two different landscape patch types. As well as exploring the general dynamics and implications of the model, we fully parameterized our model for Asian soybean rust, a multihost infectious disease that emerged in the United States in 2004. The rust fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi infects many legume species, including soybeans (Glycine max) and the nonnative invasive species kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata). Our model predicts that epidemics are driven by the host species that is more abundant in the landscape. In managed landscapes, this will generally be the domesticated host. However, many pathogens overwinter on a wild host, which acts as the source of initial inoculum at the start of the growing season. Our model predicts that very low local densities of infected wild hosts, surviving in landscape patches separate from the domesticated host, are sufficient to initiate epidemics in the domesticated host, such that managing epidemics by reducing wild host local density may not be feasible. In contrast, managing to reduce pathogen infection of a domesticated host can reduce disease impacts on wild host populations.},

Its public health importance has been largely ignored by medical science. Snake venoms are rich in protein and peptide toxins that have specificity for a wide range of tissue receptors, making them clinically challenging and scientifically fascinating, especially for drug design. Although the full burden of human suffering attributable to snake bite remains obscure, hundreds of thousands of people are known to be envenomed and tens of thousands are killed or maimed by snakes every year. Preventive efforts should be aimed towards education of affected communities to use proper footwear and to reduce the risk of contact with snakes to a minimum through understanding of snakes' behaviour. To treat envenoming, the production and clinical use of antivenom must be improved.

Outbreaks of clinical disease in Eurasia have resulted in visible mortality among populations of free-ranging wild birds in a multitude of species. The circulation pattern of influenza viruses in natural ecosystems results from a selection pressure towards strains which are indirectly transmitted by droppings from water birds and contaminated fomites, and which exhibit low pathogenicity. Some of these viruses, of the subtypes H5 or H7, can mutate into highly pathogenic strains after being introduced into domestic poultry farms. The maintenance of highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) H5N1 in several parts of the world exposes wild birds to infected poultry, resulting in long-distance virus transmission. There is great concern that these wild birds may, in turn, propagate these HPAIV or introduce them into domestic birds.

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) is lethal to humans and horses and little is known about its epidemiology. Biosecurity restrictions impede advances, particularly on understanding pathways of transmission. Quantifying HeV's environmental survival can be used for making decisions and to infer transmission pathways. We estimated HeV survival with a Weibull distribution and calculated parameters from data generated in laboratory experiments. HeV survival rates based on air temperatures 24 h after excretion ranged from 2 to 10\% in summer and from 12 to 33\% in winter. Simulated survival across the distribution of Pteropus alecto, a key reservoir host, does not predict spillover events. Based on our analyses we conclude that the most likely pathways of transmission do not require long periods of virus survival and are likely to involve relatively direct contact with flying fox excreta shortly after excretion.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus is a paramyxovirus of Australian flying fox bats. It was first detected in August 1994, after the death of 20 horses and one human. Since then it has occurred regularly within a portion of the geographical distribution of all Australian flying fox (fruit bat) species. There is, however, little understanding about which species are most likely responsible for spillover, or why spillover does not occur in other areas occupied by reservoir and spillover hosts. Using ecological niche models of the four flying fox species we were able to identify which species are most likely linked to spillover events using the concept of distance to the niche centroid of each species. With this novel approach we found that 20 out of 27 events occur disproportionately closer to the niche centroid of two species (Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus). With linear regressions we found a negative relationship between distance to the niche centroid and abundance of these two species. Thus, we suggest that the bioclimatic niche of these two species is likely driving the spatial pattern of spillover of Hendra virus into horses and ultimately humans.},

This may be due to the fact that ecological change and disease emergence are often mediated through complex and large-scale processes that are not amenable to traditional reductionist approaches to causal inference. Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, include epidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We also present several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied. Here, we outline some of the barriers to advancing our understanding of causation in disease ecology and offer some solutions for investigating large-scale ecological drivers, such as global warming, pollution, and land-use change.},

	abstract = {Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural hosts of several recently emerged zoonotic viruses of animal and human health significance in Australia and Asia, including Hendra and Nipah viruses. Satellite telemetry was used on nine flying-foxes of three species (Pteropus alecto n=5, P. vampyrus n=2, and P. neohibernicus n=2) to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region. The animals were captured and released from six different locations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste. Their movements were recorded for a median of 120 (range, 47-342) days with a median total distance travelled of 393 (range, 76-3011) km per individual. Pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Western Province) on four occasions, between Papua New Guinea (Western Province) and Indonesia (Papua) on ten occasions, and to traverse Torres Strait on two occasions. Pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (West Timor) on one occasion. These findings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by flying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of flying-fox populations in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.},

Recent outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza, and others highlight emerging zoonotic diseases as one of the key threats to global health. Similar emerging diseases have been reported in wildlife populations, resulting in mass mortalities, population declines, and even extinctions. In this paper, we highlight three examples of emerging pathogens: Nipah and Hendra virus, which emerged in Malaysia and Australia in the 1990s respectively, with recent outbreaks caused by similar viruses in India in 2000 and Bangladesh in 2004; West Nile virus, which emerged in the New World in 1999; and amphibian chytridiomycosis, which has emerged globally as a threat to amphibian populations and a major cause of amphibian population declines. We discuss a new, conservation medicine approach to emerging diseases that integrates veterinary, medical, ecologic, and other sciences in interdisciplinary teams. These teams investigate the causes of emergence, analyze the underlying drivers, and attempt to define common rules governing emergence for human, wildlife, and plant EIDs. The ultimate goal is a risk analysis that allows us to predict future emergence of known and unknown pathogens.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.},

The impact of this pathogen, however, varies markedly among amphibian species and populations. Following invasion into some areas of California's Sierra Nevada, Bd leads to rapid declines and local extinctions of frog populations (Rana muscosa, R. sierrae). In other areas, infected populations of the same frog species have declined but persisted at low host densities for many years. We present results of a 5-year study showing that infected adult frogs in persistent populations have low fungal loads, are surviving between years, and frequently lose and regain the infection. Here we put forward the hypothesis that fungal load dynamics can explain the different population-level outcomes of Bd observed in different areas of the Sierra Nevada and possibly throughout the world. We develop a model that incorporates the biological details of the Bd-host interaction. Importantly, model results suggest that host persistence versus extinction does not require differences in host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or environmental conditions, and may be just epidemic and endemic population dynamics of the same host-pathogen system. The different disease outcomes seen in natural populations may result solely from density-dependent host-pathogen dynamics. The model also shows that persistence of Bd is enhanced by the long-lived tadpole stage that characterize these two frog species, and by nonhost Bd reservoirs.},

In the current review we highlight an important series of wildlife EIDs: amphibian chytridiomycosis: diseases of marine invertebrates and vertebrates and two recently-emerged viral zoonoses, Nipah virus disease and West Nile virus disease. These exemplify the varied etiology, pathogenesis, zoonotic potential and ecological impact of wildlife EIDs. Strikingly similar underlying factors drive disease emergence in both human and wildlife populations. These are predominantly ecological and almost entirely the product of human environmental change. The implications of wildlife EIDs are twofold: emerging wildlife diseases cause direct and indirect loss of biodiversity and add to the threat of zoonotic disease emergence. Since human environmental changes are largely responsible for their emergence, the threats wildlife EIDs pose to biodiversity and human health represent yet another consequence of anthropogenic influence on ecosystems. We identify key areas where existing expertise in ecology, conservation biology, wildlife biology. veterinary medicine and the impact of environmental change would augment programs to investigate emerging diseases of humans, and we comment on the need for greater medical and microbiological input into the study of wildlife diseases.

Maximum population levels of M. arvalis were in areas from 200 to 399 in above sea, of 40 to 60 days of snow cover annually and of 10 degreesC of mean annual air temperature. Warm and moderately warm climatic regions differed in the mean M. arvalis population level with high statistical significance (t = 4.97, P = 0.01). M. arvalis did not occur in the cold climatic region and areas of less than 4degreesC of mean annual air temperature. The highest and lowest population densities were found in geographic areas of 1800 to 2000 h and up to 1600 h of annual sunshine duration, respectively. M. arvalis population density correlates with high statistical significance with the elevation above sea, annual sunshine duration and mean annual air temperature. It was, however, found that there is no correlation between M. arvalis levels and numbers of natural foci of tularaernia in the European hare (r = 0.0765, n = 396, t = 1.5228). In other words, tularaemia seems to be independent of M. arvalis population density.

	abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the prevalence of antibodies to endemic and exotic Leptospira serovars in samples from a serum bank, collected from dogs in the lower North Island of New Zealand. METHODS: Sera (n=466), which had been collected from apparently healthy dogs, were screened using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for antibodies to serovars L. borgpeterseni serovar hardjo, L. interrogans serovars pomona, copenhageni and canicola, and L. kirschneri serovar grippotyphosa. RESULTS: Antibody to leptospiral antigen was found in 14.2\% of dogs tested. The highest level of reactivity was with serovar copenhageni, to which 9.5\% (41/433) of sera were positive. Antibodies to serovars grippotyphosa and canicola were not detected in this population of dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospira infection is relatively common in dogs in the lower North Island. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Vaccination of dogs against leptospirosis should be considered using vaccine containing antigen to serovars hardjo, pomona and copenhageni. The presence of moderate levels of copenhageni antibody in dogs in the lower North Island raises the possibility that this serovar has become established in rodent populations in this region.},

Sixty-six (65\%) of 101 laboratory-confirmed cases and 125 age and sex-matched healthy neighborhood controls were interviewed. Residence in proximity to an open sewer (matched odds ratio [OR]=5.15, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.80-14.74), peri-domiciliary sighting of rats (OR=4.49, 95\% CI=1.57-12.83), sighting groups of five or more rats (OR=3.90, 95\% CI=1.35-11.27), and workplace exposure to contaminated environmental sources (OR=3.71, 95\% CI=1.35-10.17) were found to be independent risk factors for acquiring disease. Some of these risk factors are amenable to focused interventions, which include provision of closed drainage systems for sewage and reduction of rodent populations in the peri-domicilary environment. Environmental control of transmission may help to greatly reduce the incidence of severe leptospirosis.},

The magnitude of the problem in these areas is larger because of the climatic and environmental conditions the bacterium face outside their hosts but also because of the frequency of contacts between people and sources of infection. Rodents are thought to play the most important role in the transmission of human leptospirosis. We here model the dynamics of infection in an African rodent (Mastomys natalensis) that is thought to be the principal source of infection in parts of Tanzania. Our model, representing the climatic conditions in central Tanzania, suggests a strong seasonality in the force of infection on humans with a peak in the abundance of infectious mice between January and April in agricultural environments. In urban areas the dynamics are predicted to be more stable and the period of high numbers of infectious animals runs from February to July. Our results indicate that removal of animals by trapping rather than reducing the suitability of the environment for rodents will have the greater impact on reducing human cases of leptospirosis.

Results identified emigration "windows" for juveniles of each species during each year and for all years pooled. Additionally, analyses identified considerable intraspecific variation in the timing of emigration among ponds and years for at least three of the four study species. Our results are directly applicable to management strategies (e.g., road-closures) aimed at minimizing human-related impacts (e.g., road mortality) on populations of pond-breeding amphibians, as well as to mitigation strategies (e.g., maintaining engineered wetlands with an appropriate hydroperiod length) employed in cases of direct habitat loss.},

The hand musculature of the Leptodactylidae differs consistently in some respects from the musculature reported from other families, but data are available from few families. The distribution of characters of the hand muscles indicate monophyly of a number of leptodactylid groups: the subgenus Eleutherodactylus (excluding the binotatus group), the E. martinicensis group, clades consisting of Ceratophrys and Lepidobatrachus; Caudiverbera and Telmatobufo; Leptodactylus, Vanzolinius, and Hydrolaetare; and Hylodes and Megaelosia. The condition of the m, palmaris longus in the subgenus Eleutherodactylus resembles that of the hylids, particularly in the E. martinicensis group. Elongation of the mm. extensores breves profundi is a feature of arboreal members of different species groups of the subgenus Eleutherodactylus, and resembles the condition found in hylids and an arboreal microhylid. This may be an adaptation to arboreal life. No putative adaptations were found in the hand musculature of aquatic leptodactylids.},

Each pair of ponds involved one pond with presence of great crested newts (Triturus cristatus) and one pond in which newts were absent. Ponds with presence of great crested newts had a significantly higher mean number of plant species than ponds without newts. Newts occurred in ponds that tended to have a lower amount of pond area covered by surface vegetation, although this difference was not statistically significant. Macrophyte diversity also tended to increase more steeply in ponds with T. cristatus, compared with ponds without newts. Broad-leaved pond weed (Potamogeton natans) and square-leaved liverwort (Chiloscyphus pallescens) were among the plants that were most associated with presence of great crested newts. Plant diversity had a slightly more nested structure for ponds with great crested newts than for those without, which indicates a more homogeneous plant species assemblage in the former group of ponds. Overall, the results indicate that the great crested newt may be a reliable and useful indicator species for high plant species richness in ponds and small wetlands, which may be valuable for environmental monitoring and conservation in pond landscapes.},

To investigate whether estivating anurans downregulate intestinal performance as an adaptive mechanism to reduce energy expenditure, I compared the metabolic and intestinal responses to feeding, fasting and estivation among non-estivating and estivating species of the anuran families Bufonidae, Leptodactylidae and Ranidae. Standard metabolic rates of the estivating Bufo alvarius, Ceratophrys ornata and Pyxicephalus adspersus were significantly less than those of the non-estivating Bufo marinus, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and Rana catesbeiana. Whereas the digestion of rodent meals equaling 15\% of anuran body mass generated significant metabolic responses for all species, specific dynamic action was significantly greater for the estivating species. For estivating species, feeding triggered more than a doubling of small intestinal mass and significant upregulation of intestinal nutrient transport rates, resulting in six- to tenfold increases in total intestinal nutrient uptake 2595 capacity. The postprandial intestinal responses of the non-estivating species were much more modest, averaging a 50\% increase in small intestinal mass and 69\% increase in uptake capacities. Following 1 month of laboratory-induced estivation, C ornata and P. adspersus had further depressed metabolic rates by 20\%, intestinal masses by 44\%, and total intestinal uptake capacities by 60\%. In a fashion similar to infrequently feeding, sit-and-wait foraging snakes, estivating anurans; possess the capacity to severely downregulate intestinal performance with fasting and estivation, and subsequently upregulate the gut with feeding. The depression in gut performance during estivation aids in reducing energy expenditure, thereby increasing the duration that the animal can remain dormant while relying solely upon stored energy.},

	abstract = {Monitoring is required of land managers and conservation practitioners to assess the success of management actions. "Shortcuts" are sought to reduce monitoring costs, most often consisting of the selection of a small number of species that are closely monitored to represent the status of many associated species and environmental correlates. Assumptions associated with such shortcuts have been challenged, yet alternative approaches remain scant. We evaluated an approach that departs significantly from the approach of selecting a few representative species. We explored two primary assertions: (1) that a coordinated multiple-species monitoring effort that collects presence-absence data on a broad range of species is a robust alternative to a few intensive single-species efforts, and (2) that the vertebrate species expected to be detected using this approach are numerous and diverse enough to represent all vertebrate species. We simulated monitoring the vertebrate species pool on an existing sample grid across the 7 million ha of public lands in the Sierra Nevada (USA) ecoregion. Based on the use of eight standard presence-absence protocols, we estimated the number of vertebrate species (excluding fish) with an adequate number of sample points within their range to detect greater than or equal to20\% relative change in the proportion of points with detections between two points in time. We estimated that adequate detections would be obtained for 76\% of the 465 vertebrate species, including 83\% of all birds, 76\% of all mammals, 65\% of all reptiles, and 44\% of all amphibians. Detection adequacy varied among life-history and ecological groups, but {\textbackslash}textgreater50\% of the species were adequately detected in every group with the exception of three groups: rare species, endemic species, and species of concern (33\%, 24\%, and 47\% of associated species adequately detected, respectively). A multiple-species monitoring approach represents an effective and feasible alternative to the challenges of large-scale monitoring needs by targeting the most basic of population data for a large number and breadth of species.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {The past three decades have seen major declines in populations of several species of amphibians at high elevations in eastern Puerto Rico, a region unique in the humid tropics because of the degree of environmental monitoring that bets taken place through the efforts of U.S. government agencies. I examined changes in environmental conditions by examining time-series data sets that extend back at least into the 1980s, a period when frog populations were declining. The data include forest cover; annual mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperature; annual rainfall; rain and stream chemistry; and atmospheric-dust transport. I examined satellite imagery and air-chemistry samples from a single National Aeronautics and Space Administration aircraft flight across the Caribbean showing patches of pollutants, described as thin sheets or lenses, in the lower troposphere. The main source of these pollutants appeared to be fires from land clearing and deforestation, primarily in Africa. Some pollutant concentrations were high and, in the case of ozone, approached health limits set for urban air. Urban pollution impinging on Puerto Rico, dust generation from Africa (potential soil pathogens), and tropical forest burning (gaseous pollutants) have all increased during the last three decades, overlapping the timing of amphibian declines in eastern Puerto Rico. None of the data sets pointed directly to changes so extreme that they might be considered a direct lethal cause of amphibian declines in Puerto Rico. More experimental research is required to link any of these environmental factors to this problem.},

Abundance estimation methods, such as mark-recapture,. are often expensive and impractical for large-scale or long-term amphibian monitoring. We apply a new method to estimate proportion of area occupied using detection/nondetection data from a terrestrial salamander system in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimated species-specific detection probabilities were all {\textbackslash}textless1 and varied among seven species and four sampling methods. Time (i.e., sampling occasion) and four large-scale habitat characteristics (previous disturbance history, vegetation type, elevation, and stream presence) were important covariates in estimates of both proportion of area occupied and detection probability. All sampling methods were consistent in their ability to identify important covariates for each salamander species. We believe proportion of area occupied represents a useful state variable for large-scale monitoring programs. However, our results emphasize the importance of estimating detection and occupancy probabilities rather than using an unadjusted proportion of sites where species are observed where actual occupancy probabilities are confounded with detection probabilities. Estimated detection probabilities accommodate variations in sampling effort; thus comparisons of occupancy probabilities are possible among studies with different sampling protocols.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of appropriate sampling methodologies is critical for accurately determining the distribution and status of herpetofaunal populations. We report the results of a year-long drift fence study, using multiple trap types (large pitfall traps, small pitfall traps and funnel traps), of a species-rich herpetofaunal community (59 species) surrounding an isolated wedand in the southeastern United States. Specifically, we determined the effects that timing, trap type and taxon had on capture rates of herpetofauna. We found that funnel traps captured the greatest number of herpetofaunal species, but a combination of funnel traps and large pitfall traps yielded the greatest number of individual captures due to complementary biases in capture efficiencies among herpetofaunal taxa. With little exception, small pitfall traps were relatively ineffective for sampling herpetofauna. We also found that the timing of difference monitoring affected herpetofaunal species accumulation rates but that seasonal effects were taxon-specific. Our study affirms that drift fences are exceptional tools for inventorying and monitoring diverse species and large numbers of herpetofauna and also demonstrates the important effects that season and taxon can have on capture rates. Therefore, we recommend a priori delineation of project goals and the use of multiple trap types with careful attention to the timing of drift fence monitoring to maximize sampling efficiency and minimize biases associated with data collection.},

We describe patterns of diversity across major habitat types and between different seasons from an annual pitfall-trapping campaign. We recorded 28 species of amphibians, which is significantly higher than existing richness estimates for other miombo woodland sites elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We found that cultivation of native habitat reduces frog diversity, a conclusion that has important implications in light of the rapid conversion of miombo woodland for agriculture and fuel-wood across much of southern and central Africa. Many species showed strongly ansynchronized patterns of seasonality in relative abundance, which has significant implications for the establishment of successful monitoring programs and biodiversity surveys. These conclusions emphasize the importance of stratified long-term sampling in biodiversity studies and demonstrate that superficial levels of sampling effort can lead to erroneous conclusions regarding patterns of diversity in amphibian communities. The relatively poor focus on herpetofaunal research in African miombo-mopane woodland is out of proportion to its ecological and conservation significance.},

	abstract = {Although amphibians are increasingly being used to assess ecosystem function of compensatory wetlands, there are almost no long-term studies of responses to ecological restoration. Consequently, much uncertainty exists about the appropriate timeframes and best criteria for evaluating responses to wetland restoration. We studied aspects of pond colonization and long-term community dynamics in ponds created at a mitigation site in western North Carolina. We examined whether landscape variables influenced the initial colonization of 22 constructed ponds and conducted a long-term study of changes in species richness and community composition in ten constructed and ten reference ponds over seven breeding seasons. During the first year of pond filling, species richness and the number of egg masses of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) were positively correlated with pond size, depth, and hydroperiod but independent of distance to the nearest forest, paved road, or source pond. The ten constructed ponds in the long-term study first filled in 1996 and were larger, deeper, warmer, more oxygen-rich, and of longer seasonal hydroperiod than reference ponds. Seven species bred in the constructed ponds during the first year of filling, and species richness reached equilibrium within two years of initial pond filling. Most species colonized constructed ponds rapidly, but frequency of use by eastern newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) increased slowly over five years. Constructed ponds supported significantly more species than reference ponds, and the annual turnover rate of breeding populations was approximately 25\% for both pond types. Our data suggest that post-restoration monitoring for 2-3 years may be sufficient to characterize species and communities that will utilize ponds for the first decade or so after pond creation.},

These include habitat destruction, climate change, increasing levels of ultraviolet radiation, environmental contamination, disease, and the introduction of non-native species. In this paper, we argue that amphibian population declines are caused by different abiotic and biotic factors acting together in a context-dependent fashion. Moreover, different species and different populations of the same species may react in different ways to the same environmental insult. Thus, the causes of amphibian population declines will vary spatially and temporally. Although some generalizations (e.g. those concerning environmental stress and disease outbreaks) can be made about amphibian population declines, we suggest that these generalizations take into account the context-dependent dynamics of ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Assessing the success of created seasonal pools as mitigation for the loss of wooded wetlands is generally based on two or three years of monitoring. We monitored a wetland mitigation site in midcoast Maine, USA, from 1999 to 2004 to track populations of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) in three created seasonal pools. Our goal was to study breeding patterns for six years to assess if presence of breeding animals in the first three years corresponded with long-term reproductive success and to track changes in vegetation development and hydrology in the mitigated pools. Breeding effort (egg masses/female) and reproductive success (juveniles/egg mass) were assessed using full enclosure drift fence/pitfall trap arrays and egg mass counts. Breeding effort was similar in all three pools for both species. However, for wood frogs, reproductive success was inversely related to hydroperiod and highest in the single pool that successfully replicated the desired seasonal water regime. The other two pools developed permanent and semi-permanent hydroperiods, thereby supporting populations of green frogs (Rana clamitans). Green frog tadpoles within these pools preyed upon wood frog eggs and embryos, causing almost complete losses in the last four years of the study. While spotted salamander reproductive success was also reduced in the permanent pool, spotted salamanders were more successful at producing metamorphs in the presence of green frogs. Over the study period, common cattail (Typha latifolia) dominated the pools, and although wetland vegetation did develop, it was not typical of forested seasonal pools. Our work shows that the presence of breeding amphibians characteristic of seasonal pools in the first three years is not sufficient to determine reproductive success of target species in created pools. Hydrology and canopy cover are elements of critical concern if created pools are to support native amphibian communities associated with seasonal pools.},

To better understand the geographic extent of declines, their possible causes, and the measures needed to improve Latin American scientists' ability to research the phenomenon and make effective management recommendations, we convened three regional workshops with 88 Latin American herpetologists and conservationists. Population declines are widespread in Latin America. At least 13 countries have experienced declines, and in 40 cases species are now thought to be extinct or extirpated in a country where they once occurred. Declines or extinctions have affected 30 genera and nine families of amphibians. Most declines have occurred in remote highlands, above 500 m in elevation in Central America and above 1000 m In the Andes. Most documented declines occurred in the 1980s. Of the possible causes studied to date, climate change appears to be important at one site and chytrid fungal disease has been identified at sites in three countries. Although many monitoring studies are currently underway in a variety of habitats, most studies are recent and of short duration. In a signed resolution, workshop participants called for greater collaboration and communication among scientists working in Latin America to understand the geographic extent of population declines and the distribution of possible causal factors. In situ conservation is important to protect habitats, but captive-rearing programs for species subject to imminent extinction are also needed. Better understanding of the taxonomy and natural history of amphibians and more funding for research and monitoring are critical to developing a scientific basis for management action to arrest and reverse population declines.},

This paper briefl y introduces the fl ora and fauna of the Greater Everglades, focusing on species of special conservation concern and those non-native species that are altering native ecology. While there is conservation utility in cataloging biodiversity, we argue that counts of species alone are inadequate descriptors of ecosystem condition because they fail to effectively indicate emergent ecosystem properties (resilience, productivity). We develop an approach to calculating biodiversity based on systems theory that can be applied across trophic levels to provide a condition benchmark that accounts for food web interactions. The Everglades, for which detailed fl ow data between ecosystem components have been compiled as part of ongoing modeling efforts (DeAngelis et al., 1998), is among the few ecosystems globally for which this technique is currently feasible. Flow data are coupled with exogenous forcing energies (in emergy units – Odum, 1996) to compute transformity values (Odum, 1988) for biotic and abiotic components of an Everglades graminoid marsh community. We calculate across-trophic level biodiversity using the Shannon information equation applied to ecosystem emergy fl ows. Results suggest that the graminoid marsh is operating at 42 \% of theoretical maximum ecosystem fl ow diversity. By comparing observed fl ows with theoretical maximum fl ows, we provide a measure of component conservation value; we observe strong overlap between species with lower than expected emergy-based importance and those known to be currently threatened or endangered. A signifi cant positive association between this conservation value and transformity in the marsh suggests systematic uppertrophic level biodiversity degradation.},

With a proliferation of mark–recapture models and studies collecting mark–recapture data, software and analysis methods are being continually revised. We consider the construction of the likelihood for a general model that incorporates all the features of the recently developed models: it is a multistate robust–design mark–recapture model that includes dead recoveries and resightings of marked animals and is parameterised in terms of state–specific recruitment, survival, movement, and capture probabilities, state–specific abundances, and state–specific recovery and resighting probabilities. The construction that we outline is based on a factorisation of the ikelihood function with each factor corresponding to a different component of the data. Such a construction would allow the likelihood function for a mark– recapture analysis to be customized according to the components that are actually present in the dataset.},

Abundance estimation methods, such as mark–recapture, are often expensive and impractical for large-scale or long-term amphibian monitoring. We apply a new method to estimate proportion of area occupied using detection/nondetection data from a terrestrial salamander system in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Estimated speciesspecific detection probabilities were all ,1 and varied among seven species and four sampling methods. Time (i.e., sampling occasion) and four large-scale habitat characteristics (previous disturbance history, vegetation type, elevation, and stream presence) were important covariates in estimates of both proportion of area occupied and detection probability. All sampling methods were consistent in their ability to identify important covariates for each salamander species. We believe proportion of area occupied represents a useful state variable for large-scale monitoring programs. However, our results emphasize the importance of estimating detection and occupancy probabilities rather than using an unadjusted proportion of sites where species are observed where actual occupancy probabilities are confounded with detection probabilities. Estimated detection probabilities accommodate variations in sampling effort; thus comparisons of occupancy probabilities are possible among studies with different sampling protocols.},

	volume = {5},
	abstract = {Community ecological theory may play an important role in the development of a science of restoration ecology. Not only will the practice of restoration benefit from an increased focus on theory, but basic research in community ecology will also benefit. We pose several major thematic questions that are relevant to restoration from the perspective of community ecological theory and, for each, identify specific areas that are in critical need of further research to advance the science of restoration ecology. We ask, what are appropriate restoration endpoints from a community ecology perspective? The problem of measuring restoration at the community level, particularly given the high amount of variability inherent in most natural communities, is not easy, and may require a focus on restoration of community function (e.g., trophic structure) rather than a focus on the restoration of particular species. We ask, what are the benefits and limitations of using species composition or biodiversity measures as endpoints in restoration ecology? Since reestablishing all native species may rarely be possible, research is needed on the relationship between species richness and community stability of restored sites and on functional redundancy among species in regional colonist "pools." Efforts targeted at restoring system function must take into account the role of individual species, particularly if some species play a disproportionate role in processing material or are strong interactors. We ask, is restoration of habitat a sufficient approach to reestablish species and function? Many untested assumptions concerning the relationship between physical habitat structure and restoration ecology are being made in practical restoration efforts. We need rigorous testing of these assumptions, particularly to determine how generally they apply to different taxa and habitats. We ask, to what extent can empirical and theoretical work on community succession and dispersal contribute to restoration ecology? We distinguish systems in which succession theory may be broadly applicable from those in which it is probably not. If community development is highly predictable, it may be feasible to manipulate natural succession processes to accelerate restoration. We close by stressing that the science of restoration ecology is so intertwined with basic ecological theory that practical restoration efforts should rely heavily on what is known from theoretical and empirical research on how communities develop and are structured over time.},

Scientific or management objectives, appropriate spatial sampling, and detectability all must be considered when designing monitoring programs (Yoccoz et al. 2001). The ability to establish meaningful monitoring programs currently is compromised by a lack of information about amphibian detection probabilities. We used Pollock's robust design and capture-recapture models that included temporary emigration to test a priori hypotheses about spatial and temporal variation in salamander detection probability parameters for populations found in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Tennessee/North Carolina), USA. We explored the effects of 3 large-scale habitat characteristics (disturbance history elevation, vegetation type) and found that vegetation type and elevation were correlated with detection probabilities. Vegetation type was an important covariant in estimates of temporary emigration, conditional capture probability, and surface population size. Contrasts that isolated elevation effects were significant for all detection probability parameters except recapture probability, despite our small elevational range (330 m). When detection probability parameters have the potential to vary over time and space, investigators should develop monitoring designs that permit the estimation of detection probabilities.},

We used multivariate analysis of covariance to test the hypothesis that the species richness of plants, arthropods, herpetofauna, and breeding birds are correlated and increase with soil fertility (silt and clay content in sandy soils), soil variability, and hardwood midstory reduction in subxeric, nutrient-poor longleaf pine sandhills at Eglin Air Force Base in northwest Florida. During 1994-1995 and 1998-1999, we sampled 30 81-ha plots with varying fire-exclusion histories and at two spatial scales of resolution (10 x 40 m and 81 ha). The relationship between the number of plant species and percent silt and clay and its coefficient of variation was significant and positive at the plot level (81 ha) but not at the subplot level (10 x 40 m). Herpetofaunal species richness was the only faunal variable that increased with silt and clay content, but the coefficient of variation did not. Multivariate effects of hardwood reduction were significant in 1998-1999 but not in 1994-1995, which suggests that the reintroduction of fire increased species richness across taxa. Univariate effects of hardwood reduction were marginally significant for plant species richness at the subplot level and not significant for herpetofaunal species richness at either scale. Plant and arthropod species richness were not correlated. Herpetofaunal species richness was not correlated with that of other taxa (plant and animal). The species richness of plants and arthropods were each significantly positively correlated with the richness of breeding bird species at the subplot level during 1994-1995, whereas only arthropod species richness was positively correlated with bird species richness at the plot level in either year. Our results suggest that the restoration of fire regime may be the most effective tool with which to increase diversity in pyrogenic areas considered for conservation protection.},

	volume = {133},
	abstract = {Forest clearcutting is a form of habitat alteration that drastically alters the landscape and may contribute to declines in amphibian populations. indeed, many studies have documented decreases in amphibian abundances and species richness in clearcuts. The development of effective conservation strategies to reduce the effects of timber harvesting has been hindered by lack of knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these changes in abundance. To better understand the potentially negative consequences of forest clearcutting, we used field enclosures in forested and clearcut habitats to examine changes in the survival and growth of juvenile southern toads (Bufo terrestris) over a two-month period. We also conducted a comparative monitoring study using drift fences and pitfall traps in forests and clearcuts to determine the effect of clearcutting on the abundance of juvenile southern toads. We found no significant effect of habitat on the number of juvenile southern toads captured in forests or clearcuts. In contrast, the average survival of toads in clearcut enclosures was significantly reduced compared to that of toads in forested enclosures (17 +/- 5\% versus 61 +/- 3\%). Toads surviving in clearcuts were also significantly smaller than those surviving in forested enclosures (27.9 +/- 0.1 mm versus 30.3 +/- 0.8 mm SVL). Our results highlight the difficulty in interpreting abundance patterns as a sole metric for habitat comparison. Because there is much interest in studying the effects of habitat alteration on amphibian populations, we recommend that future studies place more emphasis on determining changes in vital rates of populations following habitat alteration.

The product is destroyed soils and vegetation. The natural colonization provides an insight into natural processes of primary succession. Colonization is both deterministic and stochastic. Ecosystem development involves a large measure of facilitation. Many sites left to colonize naturally are of considerable ecological value. But natural colonization is slow and ecosystem development must usually be assisted. It is now relatively easy to treat most of the factors limiting development. However, these factors must be handled with ecological understanding. Nitrogen in particular has to be built up to total levels of at least 1000 kg ha-'. Soils may have unexpectedly high phosphorus binding capacities. Treatment of toxicities may involve a number of different strategies. It is relatively easy to reintroduce agricultural and forest tree species. Wild species are more difficult, yet if their reproductive biologies are properly understood they can be handled with ease and reliability. Most animals will return on their own, but recolonization is assisted by careful habitat reconstruction and some important species may sometimes require reintroduction. Despite the readiness with which some people promulgate pessimism, here is an environmental problem for which solutions are available and one to which ecologists have an important contribution to make.},

	abstract = {Amphibian declines have been documented worldwide; however the vast majority are species associated with aquatic habitats. Information on the status and trends of terrestrial amphibians is almost entirely lacking. Here we use data collected across a 12-yr period (sampling from 1984-86 and from 1993-95) to address the question of whether evidence exists for declines among terrestrial amphibians in northwestern California forests. The majority of amphibians, both species and relative numbers, in these forests are direct-developing salamanders of the family Plethodontidae. We examined amphibian richness and evenness, and the relative abundances of the four most common species of plethodontid salamanders. We examined evidence of differences between years in two ecological provinces (coastal and interior) and across young, mature, and late seral forests and with reference to a moisture gradient from xeric to hydric within late seral forests. We found evidence of declines in species richness across years on late seral mesic stands and in the coastal ecological province, but these differences appeared to be caused by differences in the detection of rarer species, rather than evidence of an overall pattern. We also found differences among specific years in numbers of individuals of the most abundant species, Ensatina eschscholtzii, but these differences also failed to reflect a consistent pattern of declines between the two decadal sample periods. Results showing differences in richness, evenness, and relative abundances along both the seral and moisture continua were consistent with previous research. Overall, we found no compelling evidence of a downward trend in terrestrial plethodontid salamanders. We believe that continued monitoring of terrestrial salamander populations is important to understanding mechanisms of population declines in amphibian species.},

Time-constrained surveys located 15 species, with Sceloporus Jarrovii accounting for 60\% of all sightings. Urosaurus ornatus, the second most abundant species, accounted for only 12\% of the sightings; only one amphibian species (Bufo punctatus) was located. S. jarrovii was common in vegetation types with pine as a major component; it was relatively less abundant in oak-juniper; and it was absent in oak-juniper savannah. Urosaurus ornatus was the most abundant species in oak-juniper and brush types. Cnemidophorus was the most common species in the savannah vegetation type. There were no significant differences in the distribution by vegetation type within or between age and sex classes for S. Jarrovii, although juvenile males appeared to concentrate in pinyon-oak-juniper. Juveniles of both species differed from adults in that they were found significantly farther from water and tended to be in areas of less vegetative cover. Sample-size analysis showed the cumulative number of new species observed began to stabilize after about 80\% of the sampling effort was expended for all three vegetation types analyzed.

Coefficients of variation increased with series length in 27 of 29 time series that included 8 or more years. However, estimates of the coefficient of variation based on subsamples of longer time series often ranged two-to 10-fold, even with 5 or more years of data used. These results show that while some generalizations about amphibian population fluctuations might be possible, caution is necessary in selecting monitoring programs or calculating extinction risk from estimates of population variability.

	volume = {178},
	abstract = {Anuran amphibians exhibit different patterns of energy substrate utilization that correlate with the intensity of vocal and locomotor activities. Given the remarkable differences among species in breeding and feeding strategies, and the different ways energy is used in the whole animal, the suggested correlations between calling and locomotor behavior and the level of energy substrates in the muscles responsible for such activities are more complex than previously reported. We explored the relationships between calling and locomotor behavior and energy supply to trunk and hindlimb muscles, respectively, within the ecologically diverse tree-frog genus Scinax. Specifically, we measured the relative amount of carbohydrates and lipids in these two groups of muscles, and in the liver of three species of Scinax that differ in vocal and locomotor performance, and compared our results with those of two other species for which comparable data are available. We also compared the contents of lipids and carbohydrates of conspecific males collected at the beginning and after 4 h of calling activity. The stomach content to potential feeding opportunities across species was also assessed in both groups of males. Scinax hiemalis and S. rizibilis exhibit comparatively low and episodic calling during long periods of activity whereas S. crospedospilus calls at higher rates over shorter periods. Male S. hiemalis had highest levels of trunk muscle glycogen followed by those of S. rizilbilis and S. crospedospilus, respectively. There was no correlation between total lipid content in trunk muscle and calling rate among different species, suggesting that other metabolic aspects may be responsible for the energetic support for vocal activity. The levels of lipids and carbohydrates in trunk and hindlimb muscles and liver of males collected at the beginning and 4 h into the calling period were similar across species, so the extent of energetic reserves does not appear to constrain vocal or locomotor activity. Finally, we found exceptionally high levels of carbohydrates and lipids in the liver of S. rizibilis, a trait perhaps related to a long and demanding breeding period.},

	volume = {138},
	abstract = {Although breeding habitats for amphibians are frequently created in restored wetlands, populations at restored sites often have no connectivity to neighboring populations and are vulnerable to site-wide extinctions. We conducted a 13-year study to examine the persistence of amphibian populations at a geographically isolated restoration site in western North Carolina. We created a complex of breeding sites that were intended to buffer populations from environmental stressors and to enhance population persistence. Our primary efforts involved monitoring the use of 10 constructed and 10 reference ponds on site. We estimated annual juvenile production of the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) based on the number of larvae in ponds at the initiation of metamorphosis. We documented changes in adult breeding population size based on annual censuses of egg masses. Most constructed and reference ponds failed to produce juveniles annually between 1998 and 2006 as a result of stressors that included a drought, outbreaks of a lethal pathogen (Ranavirus), and the widespread occupancy of constructed ponds by fish. Despite numerous reproductive failures, a few ponds produced juveniles annually at rates that allowed wood frog and spotted salamander populations to persist at high levels. Both species exhibited strong resistance to environmental stressors, and none of six other pond-breeding amphibians that were monitored suffered site-wide extinctions from 1996 to 2006. Our results provide evidence that complex wetland designs may enhance the resistance and long-term persistence of populations that have little or no connectivity to neighboring populations.

Unfortunately, there has been no basis for predicting niche dynamics over relevant timescales, from tens to a few hundreds of years. The recent application of species distribution models (SDMs) and phylogenetic methods to analysis of niche characteristics has provided insight to niche dynamics. Niche shifts and conservatism have both occurred within the last 100 years, with recent speciation events, and deep within clades of species. There is increasing evidence that coordinated application of these methods can help to identify species which likely fulfill one key assumption in the predictive application of SDMs: an unchanging niche. This will improve confidence in SDM-based predictions of the impacts of climate change and species invasions on species distributions and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a significant threat to human health, economic stability, and biodiversity. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying disease emergence are still not fully understood, and control measures rely heavily on mitigating the impact of EIDs after they have emerged. Here, we highlight the emergence of a zoonotic Henipavirus, Nipah virus, to demonstrate the interdisciplinary and macroecological approaches necessary to understand EID emergence. Previous work suggests that Nipah virus emerged due to the interaction of the wildlife reservoir (Pteropus spp. fruit bats) with intensively managed livestock. The emergence of this and other henipaviruses involves interactions among a suite of anthropogenic environmental changes, socioeconomic factors, and changes in demography that overlay and interact with the distribution of these pathogens in their wildlife reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate how ecological niche modeling may be used to investigate the potential role of a changing climate on the future risk for Henipavirus emergence. We show that the distribution of Henipavirus reservoirs, and therefore henipaviruses, will likely change under climate change scenarios, a fundamental precondition for disease emergence in humans. We assess the variation among climate models to estimate where Henipavirus host distribution is most likely to expand, contract, or remain stable, presenting new risks for human health. We conclude that there is substantial potential to use this modeling framework to explore the distribution of wildlife hosts under a changing climate. These approaches may directly inform current and future management and surveillance strategies aiming to improve pathogen detection and, ultimately, reduce emergence risk.},

Here, we review a statistical approach, state-space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it.

Although the general geographic distributions of these epidemiologically important species are known, the spatiotemporal variation in their emergence and activity remains poorly understood. We used ecological niche modeling via a genetic algorithm to produce time-specific predictive models of monthly distributions of Aedes aegypti in Mexico in 1995. Significant predictions of monthly mosquito activity and distributions indicate that predicting spatiotemporal dynamics of disease vector species is feasible; significant coincidence with human cases of dengue indicate that these dynamics probably translate directly into transmission of dengue virus to humans. This approach provides new potential for optimizing use of resources for disease prevention and remediation via automated forecasting of disease transmission risk.},

	abstract = {Feline panleucopenia virus (FPLV) was introduced in 1977 on Marion Island (in the southern Indian Ocean) with the aim of eradicating the cat population and provoked a huge decrease in the host population within six years. The virus can be transmitted either directly through contacts between infected and healthy cats or indirectly between a healthy cat and the contaminated environment: a specific feature of the virus is its high rate of survival outside the host. In this paper, a model was designed in order to take these two modes of transmission into account. The results showed that a mass-action incidence assumption was more appropriate than a proportionate mixing one in describing the dynamics of direct transmission. Under certain conditions the virus was able to control the host population at a low density. The indirect transmission acted as a reservoir supplying the host population with a low but sufficient density of infected individuals which allowed the virus to persist. The dynamics of the infection were more affected by the demographic parameters of the healthy hosts than by the epidemiological ones. Thus, demographic parameters should be precisely measured in field studies in order to obtain accurate predictions. The predicted results of our model were in good agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {Models for infectious diseases usually assume a fixed demographic structure. Yet, a disease can spread over a region encountering different local demographic variations that may significantly alter local dynamics. Spatial heterogeneity in the resulting dynamics can lead to important differences in the design of surveillance and control strategies. We illustrate this by exploring the north-south gradient in the seasonal demography of raccoon rabies over the eastern USA. We find that the greater variance in the timing of spring births characteristic of southern populations can lead to the spatial synchronization of southern epidemics, while the narrow birth-pulse associated with northern populations can lead to an irregular patchwork of epidemics. These results indicate that surveillance in the southern states can be reduced relative to northern locations without loss of detection ability. This approach could yield significant savings in vaccination programmes. The importance of seasonality in many widely distributed diseases indicates that our findings will find applications beyond raccoon rabies.},

The recognition of seasonal patterns in infectious disease occurrence dates back at least as far as the Hippocratic era, but mechanisms underlying seasonality of person-to-person transmitted diseases are not well understood. Improved understanding will enhance understanding of host-pathogen interactions and will improve the accuracy of public health surveillance and forecasting systems. Insight into seasonal disease patterns may be gained through the use of autocorrelation methods or construction of periodograms, while seasonal oscillation of infectious diseases can be easily simulated using simple transmission models. Models demonstrate that small seasonal changes in host or pathogen factors may be sufficient to create large seasonal surges in disease incidence, which may be important particularly in the context of global climate change. Seasonality represents a rich area for future research.},

	abstract = {Most spiders use venom to paralyze their prey and are commonly feared for their potential to cause injury to humans. In North America, one species in particular, Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider, Sicariidae), causes the majority of necrotic wounds induced by the Araneae. However, its distributional limitations are poorly understood and, as a result, medical professionals routinely misdiagnose brown recluse bites outside endemic areas, confusing putative spider bites for other serious conditions. To address the issue of brown recluse distribution, we employ ecological niche modeling to investigate the present and future distributional potential of this species. We delineate range boundaries and demonstrate that under future climate change scenarios, the spider's distribution may expand northward, invading previously unaffected regions of the USA. At present, the spider's range is centered in the USA, from Kansas east to Kentucky and from southern Iowa south to Louisiana. Newly influenced areas may include parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These results illustrate a potential negative consequence of climate change on humans and will aid medical professionals in proper bite identification/treatment, potentially reducing bite misdiagnoses.},

We tested the hypothesis that spatial distributions of HPAI-H5N1 cases are related consistently and predictably to coarse-scale environmental features in the Middle East and northeastern Africa.We used ecological niche models to relate virus occurrences to 8 km resolution digital data layers summarizing parameters of monthly surface reflectance and landform. Predictive challenges included a variety of spatial stratification schemes in which models were challenged to predict case distributions in broadly unsampled areas. RESULTS: In almost all tests, HPAI-H5N1 cases were indeed occurring under predictable sets of environmental conditions, generally predicted absent from areas with low NDVI values and minimal seasonal variation, and present in areas with a broad range of and appreciable seasonal variation in NDVI values. Although we documented significant predictive ability of our models, even between our study region and West Africa, case occurrences in the Arabian Peninsula appear to follow a distinct environmental regime. CONCLUSION: Overall, we documented a variable environmental "fingerprint" for areas suitable for HPAI-H5N1 transmission.},

	abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {The divergence of bonobos and three subspecies of the common chimpanzee was examined under a multipopulation isolation-with-migration (IM) model with data from 73 loci drawn from the literature. A benefit of having a full multipopulation model, relative to conducting multiple pairwise analyses between sampled populations, is that a full model can reveal historical gene flow involving ancestral populations. An example of this was found in which gene flow is indicated between the western common chimpanzee subspecies and the ancestor of the central and the eastern common chimpanzee subspecies. The results of a full analysis on all four populations are strongly consistent with analyses on pairs of populations and generally similar to results from previous studies. The basal split between bonobos and common chimpanzees was estimated at 0.93 Ma (0.68-1.54 Ma, 95\% highest posterior density interval), with the split among the ancestor of three common chimpanzee populations at 0.46 Ma (0.35-0.65), and the most recent split between central and eastern common chimpanzee populations at 0.093 Ma (0.041-0.157). Population size estimates mostly fell in the range from 5,000 to 10,000 individuals. The exceptions are the size of the ancestor of the common chimpanzee and the bonobo, at 17,000 (8,000-28,000) individuals, and the central common chimpanzee and its immediate ancestor with the eastern common chimpanzee, which have effective size estimates at 27,000 (16,000-44,000) and 32,000 (19,000-54,000) individuals, respectively.},

	abstract = {Species are defined using a variety of different operational techniques. While discussion of the various methodologies has previously been restricted mostly to taxonomists, the demarcation of species is also crucial for conservation biology. Unfortunately, different methods of diagnosing species can arrive at different entities. Most prominently, it is widely thought that use of a phylogenetic species concept may lead to recognition of a far greater number of much less inclusive units. As a result, studies of the same group of organisms can produce not only different species identities but also different species range and number of individuals. To assess the impact of different definitions on conservation issues, we collected instances from the literature where a group of organisms was categorized both under phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic concepts. Our results show a marked difference, with surveys based on a phylogenetic species concept showing more species (48\%) and an associated decrease in population size and range. We discuss the serious consequences of this trend for conservation, including an apparent change in the number of endangered species, potential political fallout, and the difficulty of deciding what should be conserved.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows listing of subspecies and other groupings below the rank of species. This provides the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service with a means to target the most critical unit in need of conservation. Although roughly one-quarter of listed taxa are subspecies, these management agencies are hindered by uncertainties about taxonomic standards during listing or delisting activities. In a review of taxonomic publications and societies, we found few subspecies lists and none that stated standardized criteria for determining subspecific taxa. Lack of criteria is attributed to a centuries-old debate over species and subspecies concepts. Nevertheless, the critical need to resolve this debate for ESA listings led us to propose that minimal biological criteria to define disjunct subspecies (legally or taxonomically) should include the discreteness and significance criteria of distinct population segments (as defined under the ESA). Our subspecies criteria are in stark contrast to that proposed by supporters of the phylogenetic species concept and provide a clear distinction between species and subspecies. Efforts to eliminate or reduce ambiguity associated with subspecies-level classifications will assist with ESA listing decisions. Thus, we urge professional taxonomic societies to publish and periodically update peer-reviewed species and subspecies lists. This effort must be paralleled throughout the world for efficient taxonomic conservation to take place.},

	abstract = {Species delimitation and species concepts have been a matter of debate among biodiversity researchers in the last decades, resulting in integrative taxonomy approaches and the use of modern species concepts, such as the phylogenetic, evolutionary or general lineage species concepts. The discussion of subspecies status and concepts has been addressed much less extensively, with some researchers completely refraining from recognizing subspecies. However, allopatric insular populations that are particularly differentiated have traditionally been assigned subspecies status. We studied the molecular phylogeny and morphology of endemic Comoran tree snakes of the genus Lycodryas. Taking an integrative taxonomic approach, we used the concept of independent lines of evidence to discriminate between evidence for specific and subspecific status. Molecular (mtDNA) and morphological data provided sufficient evidence to support four different taxa within Comoran Lycodryas. In a revision of this group, we propose two species, each with two subspecies. We present a discussion of the strong sexual dichromatism unique to Comoran Lycodryas within the genus and related genera that may be explained by sexual selection in combination with the absence of major predators. Then, we discuss the effects of insular evolution and the "island rule" on morphological traits in Comoran Lycodryas and in Liophidium mayottensis, another snake endemic to the Comoros. The absence of larger-bodied snakes may have promoted an increase in body size and the number of dorsal scale rows in these species. Finally, we discuss the subspecies concept, its applications and its significance for integrative taxonomy and for limiting taxonomic inflation. We emphasize that taxon descriptions should be based on an integrative approach using several lines of evidence, preferably in combination with statements on the underlying species concepts or operational criteria, to increase the objectivity and comparability of descriptions.},

Mitochondrial DNA sequence data reveal that 97\% of continentally distributed avian subspecies lack the population genetic structure indicative of a distinct evolutionary unit. Subspecies considered threatened or endangered, some of which have been targets of expensive restoration efforts, also generally lack genetic distinctiveness. Although sequence data show that species include 1.9 historically significant units on average, these units are not reflected by current subspecies nomenclature. Yet, it is these unnamed units and not named subspecies that should play a major role in guiding conservation efforts and in identifying biological diversity. Thus, a massive reorganization of classifications is required so that the lowest ranks, be they species or subspecies, reflect evolutionary diversity. Until such reorganization is accomplished, the subspecies rank will continue to hinder progress in taxonomy, evolutionary studies and especially conservation.},

To better understand the perpetuation of AIV in natural water bodies, and thus the risks of AIV spread and transmission via such bodies, we systematically studied the inactivation dynamics of two AIV strains (H5N1 and H9N2) at different temperatures in water bodies of important migratory bird habitats within China (Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, the Hubei segment of the Yangtze River and Qinghai Lake). We also studied the impact of water-borne micro-organisms on the perpetuation of AIV. Our findings indicated that water is very likely an important route for the epidemic spread of AIV, especially during the autumn and winter seasons.

Además, se realiza un análisis al nivel de polígono sobre la dinámica de las superficies forestales con vegetación secundaria, con la finalidad de establecer si se trata de un proceso de recuperación o de alteración forestal. Los resultados encontrados demuestran que las tasas de cambio han disminuido en el periodo 2000-2007, pero que la superficie forestal disminuye anualmente en alrededor de 500 000 ha. Para el periodo 1976-2007, se encontró una pérdida anual de 534 707 ha. Los datos oficiales de deforestación muestran una subvaluación a partir de 2006, ya que se descuenta 100\% de la superficie ocupada por vegetación secundaria, cuando en la realidad el proceso de recuperación es de entre 10\% y 13\% de dicha superficie. Con el dato ajustado del proceso de recuperación se recalcularon las cifras oficiales publicadas a partir de 2006, mostrando consistencia en relación con la estabilización de la superficie anual deforestada.

	abstract = {The extent to which the biodiversity and community composition of ecosystems affect their functions is an issue that grows ever more compelling as human impacts on ecosystems increase. We present evidence that supports a novel function of vertebrate biodiversity, the buffering of human risk of exposure to Lyme-disease-bearing ticks. We tested the Dilution Effect model, which predicts that high species diversity in the community of tick hosts reduces vector infection prevalence by diluting the effects of the most competent disease reservoir, the ubiquitous white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). As habitats are degraded by fragmentation or other anthropogenic forces, some members of the host community disappear. Thus, species-poor communities tend to have mice, but few other hosts, whereas species-rich communities have mice, plus many other potential hosts. We demonstrate that the most common nonmouse hosts are relatively poor reservoirs for the Lyme spirochete and should reduce the prevalence of the disease by feeding, but rarely infecting, ticks. By accounting for nearly every host species' contribution to the number of larval ticks fed and infected, we show that as new host species are added to a depauperate community, the nymphal infection prevalence, a key risk factor, declines. We identify important "dilution hosts" (e.g., squirrels), characterized by high tick burdens, low reservoir competence, and high population density, as well as "rescue hosts" (e.g., shrews), which are capable of maintaining high disease risk when mouse density is low. Our study suggests that the preservation of vertebrate biodiversity and community composition can reduce the incidence of Lyme disease.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) was first described in 1994 in an outbreak of acute and highly lethal disease in horses and humans in Australia. Equine cases continue to be diagnosed periodically, yet the predisposing factors for infection remain unclear. We undertook an analysis of equine submissions tested for HeV by the Queensland government veterinary reference laboratory over a 20-year period to identify and investigate any patterns. We found a marked increase in testing from July 2008, primarily reflecting a broadening of the HeV clinical case definition. Peaks in submissions for testing, and visitations to the Government HeV website, were associated with reported equine incidents. Significantly differing between-year HeV detection rates in north and south Queensland suggest a fundamental difference in risk exposure between the two regions. The statistical association between HeV detection and stockhorse type may suggest that husbandry is a more important risk determinant than breed per se . The detection of HeV in horses with neither neurological nor respiratory signs poses a risk management challenge for attending veterinarians and laboratory staff, reinforcing animal health authority recommendations that appropriate risk management strategies be employed for all sick horses, and by anyone handling sick horses or associated biological samples.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Environmental niche models that utilize presence-only data have been increasingly employed to model species distributions and test ecological and evolutionary predictions. The ideal method for evaluating the accuracy of a niche model is to train a model with one dataset and then test model predictions against an independent dataset. However, a truly independent dataset is often not available, and instead random subsets of the total data are used for ‘training' and ‘testing' purposes. The goal of this study was to determine how spatially autocorrelated sampling affects measures of niche model accuracy when using subsets of a larger dataset for accuracy evaluation. Location The distribution of Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed; Asteraceae) was modelled in six states in the western United States: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. Methods Two types of niche modelling algorithms – the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and maximum entropy modelling (as implemented with Maxent) – were used to model the potential distribution of C. maculosa across the region. The effect of spatially autocorrelated sampling was examined by applying a spatial filter to the presence-only data (to reduce autocorrelation) and then comparing predictions made using the spatial filter with those using a random subset of the data, equal in sample size to the filtered data. Results The accuracy of predictions from both algorithms was sensitive to the spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort in the occurrence data. Spatial filtering led to lower values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve plot but higher similarity statistic (I) values when compared with predictions from models built with random subsets of the total data, meaning that spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between training and test data led to inflated measures of accuracy. Main conclusions The findings indicate that care should be taken when interpreting the results from presence-only niche models when training and test data have been randomly partitioned but occurrence data were non-randomly sampled (in a spatially autocorrelated manner). The higher accuracies obtained without the spatial filter are a result of spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between training and test data inflating measures of prediction accuracy. If independently surveyed data for testing predictions are unavailable, then it may be necessary to explicitly account for the spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between randomly partitioned training and test subsets when evaluating niche model predictions.},

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5×0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

	abstract = {The Grey-headed Flying-fox Pteropus poliocephalus has an expansive range. However, the species actually occupies a relatively restricted and continuously changing habitat area, which is primarily defined by irregular patterns of nectar availability. A synchronous count of Grey-headed Flying-foxes in New South Wales taken in July 1998 described the distribution and abundance of the species during a time of general food scarcity, but when abundant floral resources were available in restricted patches of coastal vegetation. The population was highly concentrated into small habitat areas associated with this flowering. The species occupied 11 camps which were located at irregular intervals along the coast, north from the Sydney region. Over 99\% of the New South Wales population occurred in nine camps. The total abundance of animals in the state was estimated at 85 400. These results vary substantially from recent estimations which placed the size of the New South Wales population at one million animals. Black Flying-foxes occupied seven camps at the time of the count and their abundance was estimated at 72 500. Periods of concentration are periods of vulnerability for migratory species and present appropriate circumstances in which to examine their conservation status. Critical winter habitat used by Grey-headed Flying-foxes at the time of this study is poorly reserved, primarily occurs on privately-owned land and is located in areas targeted for urban and rural residential development to cater for an ongoing, rapid increase in human population. The conclusion drawn from this study was that Grey-headed Flying-foxes are vulnerable to population decline from the ongoing clearing of their critical over-wintering habitat in lowland coastal vegetation in north-east New South Wales and south-east Queensland. These results support their listing as Vulnerable in the 1999 Action Plan for Australian Bats.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

Information was collected on location, husbandry, and feeding management of their horse(s), pasture conditions, the observation of specified behaviors and forage selection by their horse(s) at pasture. The survey had 497 respondents across Australia who owned a total of 3,082 horses. Most horses (85\%) had access to grazing areas 16-24hours per day. Owners commonly (90\%) observed ???1 pasture problems on their property, and the mean number of problems was similar across grazing areas of {\textbackslash}textless2, 2-10, and {\textbackslash}textgreater10ha. Although the horses had access to pasture, there was a heavy reliance on supplementary feeding. Approximately 95\% of the horses were fed concentrates and/or supplements on a daily basis, and 86\% of the horses were offered conserved forage. Surveyed behaviors were reported by 75\% of the respondents, with bark chewing and licking or eating dirt being the most prevalent behaviors. Almost three-quarters of the horse owners indicated that their horses browse on parts of trees, shrubs, or other nonpasture species. This study verifies that Australian horses consume a range of nonpasture species and frequently demonstrate bark-chewing behavior while at pasture. It is currently unclear if the selections of browse and bark stripping observed in this study are a function of reduced pasture availability or vegetation diversity and diet choices.},

In laboratory-based studies, LPAI viruses can remain infective for extended durations (months) in water, but the persistence is strongly dependent on water conditions (temperature, salinity, pH) and virus strain. Little is known about the stability of H5N1 HPAI viruses in water. With the use of an established laboratory model system, the persistence of 11 strains of H5N1 HPAI virus was measured in buffered distilled water (pH 7.2) at two temperatures (17 and 28 C) and three salinities (0, 15,000, and 30,000 ppm). There was extensive variation between the 11 H5N1 HPAI virus strains in the overall stability in water, with a range similar to that which has been reported for wild-bird–origin LPAI viruses. The H5N1 HPAI virus strains responded similarly to different water temperatures and salinities, with all viruses being most stable at colder temperatures and fresh to brackish salinities. These results indicate that the overall stability and response of H5N1 HPAI viruses in water is similar to LPAI viruses, and suggest there has been no increase or loss of environmental survivability in H5N1 HPAI viruses.},

Ecology and epidemiology are highly related disciplines that may contribute to improvements in mapping disease, which can be used to answer health related questions. Ecological niche modeling is increasingly used for understanding the biogeography of diseases in plants, animals, and humans. However, epidemiological applications of niche modeling approaches for disease mapping can fail to generate robust study designs, producing incomplete or incorrect inferences. This manuscript is an overview of the history and conceptual bases behind ecological niche modeling, specifically as applied to epidemiology and public health; it does not pretend to be an exhaustive and detailed description of ecological niche modeling literature and methods. Instead, this review includes selected state-of-the-science approaches and tools, providing a short guide to designing studies incorporating information on the type and quality of the input data (i.e., occurrences and environmental variables), identification and justification of the extent of the study area, and encourages users to explore and test diverse algorithms for more informed conclusions. We provide a friendly introduction to the field of disease biogeography presenting an updated guide for researchers looking to use ecological niche modeling for disease mapping. We anticipate that ecological niche modeling will soon be a critical tool for epidemiologists aiming to map disease transmission risk, forecast disease distribution under climate change scenarios, and identify landscape factors triggering outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.},

	abstract = {Urbanisation of wildlife populations is a process with significant conservation and management implications. While urban areas can provide habitat for wildlife, some urbanised species eventually come into conflict with humans. Understanding the process and drivers of wildlife urbanisation is fundamental to developing effective management responses to this phenomenon. In Australia, flying-foxes (Pteropodidae) are a common feature of urban environments, sometimes roosting in groups of tens of thousands of individuals. Flying-foxes appear to be becoming increasingly urbanised and are coming into increased contact and conflict with humans. Flying-fox management is now a highly contentious issue. In this study we used monitoring data collected over a 15 year period (1998-2012) to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of association of spectacled flying-fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) roost sites (camps) with urban areas. We asked whether spectacled flying-foxes are becoming more urbanised and test the hypothesis that such changes are associated with anthropogenic changes to landscape structure. Our results indicate that spectacled flying-foxes were more likely to roost near humans than might be expected by chance, that over the period of the study the proportion of the flying-foxes in urban-associated camps increased, as did the number of urban camps. Increased urbanisation of spectacled flying-foxes was not related to changes in landscape structure or to the encroachment of urban areas on camps. Overall, camps tended to be found in areas that were more fragmented, closer to human habitation and with more urban land cover than the surrounding landscape. This suggests that urbanisation is a behavioural response rather than driven by habitat loss.},

	abstract = {Background: Nipah virus (NiV) is a significant emerging zoonotic pathogen given its wide geographic distribution, and the severe morbidity and high mortality that accompanies infection. Moreover, the layered landscape epidemiology surrounding spillover from reservoir host species to humans is ill-defined. Identifying landscape features that contribute to NiV spillover would likely prove helpful in preventing emergence in human populations. Methods: Using an inhomogeneous Poisson model, this study investigated the role of vegetation cover, the human footprint (HFP) and reservoir Pteropus bat distribution to identify the spatial dependence of spillover and map risk across South and Southeast Asia. Results: The spatial model identified HFP (RR=1.08; 95\% CI 1.05–1.11) and bat distribution (RR=19.44; 95\% CI 1.92–196.7) as significant predictors of NiV risk, while vegetation cover was not significant after accounting for HFP and the presence of Pteropus bats. Conclusions: These findings further inform the landscape epidemiology of NiV and suggest specific conduits for spillover in the landscape. However, more detailed field studies will be required to validate these results.},

	abstract = {This study employs spatial filtering of occurrence data with the aim of reducing overfitting to sampling bias in ecological niche models (ENMs). Sampling bias in geographic space leads to localities that may also be biased in environmental space. If so, the model can overfit to those biases. As a preliminary test addressing this issue, we used Maxent, bioclimatic variables, and occurrence localities of a broadly distributed Malagasy tenrec, Microgale cowani (Tenrecidae: Oryzorictinae). We modeled the abiotically suitable area of this species using three distinct datasets: unfiltered, spatially filtered, and rarefied unfiltered localities. To quantify overfitting and model performance, we calculated evaluation AUC, the difference between calibration and evaluation AUC (=AUCdiff), and omission rates. Models made with the filtered dataset showed lower overfitting and better performance than the other two suites of models, having lower omission rates and AUCdiff, and a higher AUCevaluation. Additionally, the rarefied unfiltered dataset performed better than the unfiltered one for three evaluation metrics, likely because the larger one reinforced the biases. These results indicate that spatial filtering of occurrence localities may allow biogeographers to produce better models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Climate change projections for Australia predict increasing temperatures, changes to rainfall patterns, and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The aims of this study were to predict plant production responses to elevated CO2 concentrations using the SGS Pasture Model and DairyMod, and then to quantify the effects of climate change scenarios for 2030 and 2070 on predicted pasture growth, species composition, and soil moisture conditions of 5 existing pasture systems in climates ranging from cool temperate to subtropical, relative to a historical baseline. Three future climate scenarios were created for each site by adjusting historical climate data according to temperature and rainfall change projections for 2030, 2070 mid- and 2070 high-emission scenarios, using output from the CSIRO Mark 3 global climate model. In the absence of other climate changes, mean annual pasture production at an elevated CO2 concentration of 550 ppm was predicted to be 24–29\% higher than at 380 ppm CO2 in temperate (C3) species-dominant pastures in southern Australia, with lower mean responses in a mixed C3/C4 pasture at Barraba in northern New South Wales (17\%) and in a C4 pasture at Mutdapilly in south-eastern Queensland (9\%). In the future climate scenarios at the Barraba and Mutdapilly sites in subtropical and subhumid climates, respectively, where climate projections indicated warming of up to 4.4°C, with little change in annual rainfall, modelling predicted increased pasture production and a shift towards C4 species dominance. In Mediterranean, temperate, and cool temperate climates, climate change projections indicated warming of up to 3.3°C, with annual rainfall reduced by up to 28\%. Under future climate scenarios at Wagga Wagga, NSW, and Ellinbank, Victoria, our study predicted increased winter and early spring pasture growth rates, but this was counteracted by a predicted shorter spring growing season, with annual pasture production higher than the baseline under the 2030 climate scenario, but reduced by up to 19\% under the 2070 high scenario. In a cool temperate environment at Elliott, Tasmania, annual production was higher than the baseline in all 3 future climate scenarios, but highest in the 2070 mid scenario. At the Wagga Wagga, Ellinbank, and Elliott sites the effect of rainfall declines on pasture production was moderated by a predicted reduction in drainage below the root zone and, at Ellinbank, the use of deeper rooted plant systems was shown to be an effective adaptation to mitigate some of the effect of lower rainfall.},

Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events. This work provides a foundation for transdisciplinary investigation of spillover and synthetic theory on zoonotic transmission.},

	abstract = {Many pathogens, including those infecting insects, are transmitted via dormant stages shed into the environment, where they must persist until encountering a susceptible host. Understanding how abiotic conditions influence environmental persistence and how these factors influence pathogen spread are crucial for predicting patterns of infection risk. Here, we explored the consequences of environmental transmission for infection dynamics of a debilitating protozoan parasite (Ophryocystis elektroscirrha) that infects monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). We first conducted an experiment to observe the persistence of protozoan spores exposed to natural conditions. Experimental results showed that, contrary to our expectations, pathogen doses maintained high infectivity even after 16 days in the environment, although pathogens did yield infections with lower parasite loads after environmental exposure. Because pathogen longevity exceeded the time span of our experiment, we developed a mechanistic model to better explore environmental persistence for this host-pathogen system. Model analysis showed that, in general, longer spore persistence led to higher infection prevalence and slightly smaller monarch population sizes. The model indicated that typical parasite doses shed onto milkweed plants must remain viable for a minimum of 3 weeks for prevalence to increase during the summer-breeding season, and for 11 weeks or longer to match levels of infection commonly reported from the wild, assuming moderate values for parasite shedding rate. Our findings showed that transmission stages of this butterfly pathogen are long-lived and indicated that this is a necessary condition for the protozoan to persist in local monarch populations. This study provides a modeling framework for future work examining the dynamics of an ecologically important pathogen in an iconic insect.},

Models of pathogens show that sapronoses, lacking a threshold of transmission, cannot regulate host populations, although they can reduce host abundance and even extirpate their hosts. Immunocompromised hosts are relatively susceptible to sapronoses. Some particularly important sapronoses, such as cholera and anthrax, can sustain an epidemic in a host population. However, these microbes ultimately persist as saprophages. One-third of human infectious disease agents are sapronotic, including nearly all fungal diseases.

Hendra virus is endemic in Australian pteropodid bat populations and can be lethal to horses and humans. However, we know little about the factors driving Hendra virus prevalence in resevoir bat populations, making spillover difficult to predict. We use Hendra virus prevalence data collected from 13 000 pooled bat urine samples across space and time to determine if pulses of prevalence are periodic and synchronized across sites. We also test whether site-specific precipitation and temperature affect the amplitude of the largest annual prevalence pulses. We found little evidence for a periodic signal in Hendra virus prevalence. Although the largest amplitude pulses tended to occur over winter, pulses could also occur in other seasons. We found that Hendra virus prevalence was weakly synchronized across sites over short distances, suggesting that prevalence is driven by local-scale effects. Finally, we found that drier conditions in previous seasons and the abundance of Pteropus alecto were positively correlated with the peak annual values of Hendra virus prevalence. Our results suggest that in addition to seasonal effects, bat density and local climatic conditions interact to drive Hendra virus infection dynamics.},

Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some “hotspots” of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option.},

Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature.

Among factors that limit transmission, the environment is particularly important for indirectly transmitted parasites. To try and assess a pathogens' ability to be transmitted through the environment and mitigate risk, we need to quantify its decay where transmission occurs in space such as the microclimate harbouring the pathogen. Hendra virus, a Henipavirus from Australian Pteropid bats, spills-over to horses and humans, causing high mortality. While a vaccine is available, its limited uptake has reduced opportunities for adequate risk management to humans, hence the need to develop synergistic prevent ive measures, like disrupting its transmission pathways. Transmission likely occurs shortly after virus excretion in paddocks; however, no survival estimates to date have used real environmental conditions. Here, we recorded microclimate conditions and fitted models that predict temperatures and potential evaporation, which we used to simulate virus survival with a temperature-survival model and modification based on evaporation. Predicted survival was lower than previously estimated and likely to be even lower according to potential evaporation. Our results indicate that transmission should occur shortly after the virus is excreted, in a relatively direct way. When potential evaporation is low, and survival is more similar to temperature dependent estimates, transmission might be indirect because the virus can wait several hours until contact is made. We recommend restricting horses' access to trees during night time and reducing grass under trees to reduce virus survival.},

We estimated HeV survival with a Weibull distribution and calculated parameters from data generated in laboratory experiments. HeV survival rates based on air temperatures 24 h after excretion ranged from 2 to 10\% in summer and from 12 to 33\% in winter. Simulated survival across the distribution of the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), a key reservoir host, did not predict spillover events.

Since then it has occurred regularly within a portion of the geographical distribution of all Australian flying fox (fruit bat) species. There is, however, little understanding about which species are most likely responsible for spillover, or why spillover does not occur in other areas occupied by reservoir and spillover hosts. Using ecological niche models of the four flying fox species we were able to identify which species are most likely linked to spillover events using the concept of distance to the niche centroid of each species. With this novel approach we found that 20 out of 27 events occur disproportionately closer to the niche centroid of two species (P. alecto and P. conspicillatus). With linear regressions we found a negative relationship between distance to the niche centroid and abundance of these two species. Thus, we suggest that the bioclimatic niche of these two species is likely driving the spatial pattern of spillover of Hendra virus into horses and ultimately humans.},

This mosquito had been reported from 36 geographic locations in Mexico by 2005, increasing to 101 locations by 2010 and 501 locations (spanning 16 states) by 2016. Here we modeled the occupied niche for Ae. albopictus in Mexico to characterize the environmental conditions related to its presence, and to generate updated environmental suitability maps. The predictors with the greatest contribution to characterizing the occupied niche for Ae. albopictus were NDVI and annual mean temperature. We also estimated the environmental suitability for Ae. albopictus in regions of the country where it has not been documented yet, by means of: 1) transferring its occupied niche model to these regions and 2) modeling its fundamental niche using global data. Our models will help vector control and public health institutions to identify areas where Ae. albopictus has not yet been recorded but where it may be present. We emphasize that most of Mexico has environmental conditions that potentially allow the survival of Ae. albopictus, which underscores the need for systematic mosquito monitoring in all states of the country.},

Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.},

	abstract = {© 2018 EcoHealth Alliance Understanding environmental factors driving spatiotemporal patterns of disease can improve risk mitigation strategies. Hendra virus (HeV), discovered in Australia in 1994, spills over from bats (Pteropus sp.) to horses and thence to humans. Below latitude − 22°, almost all spillover events to horses occur during winter, and above this latitude spillover is aseasonal. We generated a statistical model of environmental drivers of HeV spillover per month. The model reproduced the spatiotemporal pattern of spillover risk between 1994 and 2015. The model was generated with an ensemble of methods for presence–absence data (boosted regression trees, random forests and logistic regression). Presences were the locations of horse cases, and absences per spatial unit (2.7 × 2.7 km pixels without spillover) were sampled with the horse census of Queensland and New South Wales. The most influential factors indicate that spillover is associated with both cold-dry and wet conditions. Bimodal responses to several variables suggest spillover involves two systems: one above and one below a latitudinal area close to − 22°. Northern spillovers are associated with cold-dry and wet conditions, and southern with cold-dry conditions. Biologically, these patterns could be driven by immune or behavioural changes in response to food shortage in bats and horse husbandry. Future research should look for differences in these traits between seasons in the two latitudinal regions. Based on the predicted risk patterns by latitude, we recommend enhanced preventive management for horses from March to November below latitude 22° south.},

We produced two models to estimate areas at potential risk of HeV spillover explained by the climatic suitability for its flying fox reservoir hosts, Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus. We included additional climatic variables that might affect spillover risk through other biological processes (such as bat or horse behaviour, plant phenology and bat foraging habitat). Models were fit with a Poisson point process model and a log-Gaussian Cox process. In response to climate change, risk expanded southwards due to an expansion of P. alecto suitable habitat, which increased the number of horses at risk by 175–260\% (110,000–165,000). In the northern limits of the current distribution, spillover risk was highly uncertain because of model extrapolation to novel climatic conditions. The extent of areas at risk of spillover from P. conspicillatus was predicted shrink. Due to a likely expansion of P. alecto into these areas, it could replace P. conspicillatus as the main HeV reservoir. We recommend: (1) HeV monitoring in bats, (2) enhancing HeV prevention in horses in areas predicted to be at risk, (3) investigate and develop mitigation strategies for areas that could experience reservoir host replacements.},

	abstract = {In this review we examine the hypothesis that aquatic birds are the primordial source of all influenza viruses in other species and study the ecological features that permit the perpetuation of influenza viruses in aquatic avian species. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of influenza A virus RNA segments coding for the spike proteins (HA, NA, and M2) and the internal proteins (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) from a wide range of hosts, geographical regions, and influenza A virus subtypes support the following conclusions. (i) Two partly overlapping reservoirs of influenza A viruses exist in migrating waterfowl and shorebirds throughout the world. These species harbor influenza viruses of all the known HA and NA subtypes. (ii) Influenza viruses have evolved into a number of host-specific lineages that are exemplified by the NP gene and include equine Prague/56, recent equine strains, classical swine and human strains, H13 gull strains, and all other avian strains. Other genes show similar patterns, but with extensive evidence of genetic reassortment. Geographical as well as host-specific lineages are evident. (iii) All of the influenza A viruses of mammalian sources originated from the avian gene pool, and it is possible that influenza B viruses also arose from the same source. (iv) The different virus lineages are predominantly host specific, but there are periodic exchanges of influenza virus genes or whole viruses between species, giving rise to pandemics of disease in humans, lower animals, and birds. (v) The influenza viruses currently circulating in humans and pigs in North America originated by transmission of all genes from the avian reservoir prior to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic; some of the genes have subsequently been replaced by others from the influenza gene pool in birds. (vi) The influenza virus gene pool in aquatic birds of the world is probably perpetuated by low-level transmission within that species throughout the year. (vii) There is evidence that most new human pandemic strains and variants have originated in southern China. (viii) There is speculation that pigs may serve as the intermediate host in genetic exchange between influenza viruses in avian and humans, but experimental evidence is lacking. (ix) Once the ecological properties of influenza viruses are understood, it may be possible to interdict the introduction of new influenza viruses into humans.},

Influenza species barriers can be categorized into virus-host interactions occurring within individuals and host-host interactions, either within or between species, that affect transmission between individuals.

	abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-OIV epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-OIV outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-OIV is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

Since 1997 in southeast Asia, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been causing severe, even fatal disease in humans. Although no lineages of this subtype have been established until now, such repeated events may initiate a new pandemic. As a model of species transmission, we used the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus SC35 (H7N7), which is low-pathogenic for mice, and its lethal mouse-adapted descendant SC35M. Specific mutations in SC35M polymerase considerably increase its activity in mammalian cells, correlating with high virulence in mice. Some of these mutations are prevalent in chicken and mammalian isolates, especially in the highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses from southeast Asia. These activity-enhancing mutations of the viral polymerase complex demonstrate convergent evolution in nature and, therefore, may be a prerequisite for adaptation to a new host paving the way for new pandemic viruses.},

In this study, we analysed replication, host specificity and pathogenicity of avian and mammalian influenza viruses, in importin-α-silenced cells and importin-α-knockout mice, to understand the role of individual importin-α isoforms in adaptation. For efficient virus replication, the polymerase subunit PB2 and the nucleoprotein (NP) of avian viruses required importin-α3, whereas PB2 and NP of mammalian viruses showed importin-α7 specificity. H1N1v replication depended on both, importin-α3 and -α7, suggesting ongoing adaptation of this virus. Thus, differences in importin-α specificity are determinants of host range underlining the importance of the nuclear envelope in interspecies transmission.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza viruses are able to persist in the environment, in-between the transmission of the virus among its natural hosts. Quantifying the environmental factors that affect the persistence of avian influenza virus is important for influencing our ability to predict future outbreaks and target surveillance and control methods. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the environmental factors that affect the decay of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in water. Abiotic factors affecting the persistence of LPAIV have been investigated for nearly 40 years, yet published data was produced by only 26 quantitative studies. These studies have been conducted by a small number of principal authors (n = 17) and have investigated a narrow range of environmental conditions, all of which were based in laboratories with limited reflection of natural conditions. The use of quantitative meta-analytic techniques provided the opportunity to assess persistence across a greater range of conditions than each individual study can achieve, through the estimation of mean effect-sizes and relationships among multiple variables. Temperature was the most influential variable, for both the strength and magnitude of the effect-size. Moderator variables explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity among effect-sizes. Salinity and pH were important factors, although future work is required to broaden the range of abiotic factors examined, as well as including further diurnal variation and greater environmental realism generally. We were unable to extract a quantitative effect-size estimate for approximately half (50.4\%) of the reported experimental outcomes and we strongly recommend a minimum set of quantitative reporting to be included in all studies, which will allow robust assimilation and analysis of future findings. In addition we suggest possible means of increasing the applicability of future studies to the natural environment, and evaluating the biological content of natural waterbodies. © 2016 Dalziel et al.

During a large-scale surveillance programme over Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we detected avian influenza viruses of H5N2 subtype with a highly pathogenic (HP) viral genotype in healthy birds of two wild waterfowl species sampled in Nigeria. We monitored the survival and regional movements of one of the infected birds through satellite telemetry, providing a rare evidence of a non-lethal natural infection by an HP viral genotype in wild birds. Phylogenetic analysis of the H5N2 viruses revealed close genetic relationships with H5 viruses of low pathogenicity circulating in Eurasian wild and domestic ducks. In addition, genetic analysis did not reveal known gallinaceous poultry adaptive mutations, suggesting that the emergence of HP strains could have taken place in either wild or domestic ducks or in non-gallinaceous species. The presence of coexisting but genetically distinguishable avian influenza viruses with an HP viral genotype in two cohabiting species of wild waterfowl, with evidence of non-lethal infection at least in one species and without evidence of prior extensive circulation of the virus in domestic poultry, suggest that some strains with a potential high pathogenicity for poultry could be maintained in a community of wild waterfowl.},

Outbreaks in gallinaceous birds occurred in some live poultry markets concurrently with the second waterfowl outbreak, and infection on a chicken farm was detected 1 week after the second waterfowl park outbreak was detected, on the same day the second grey heron case was detected. Subsequent virus surveillance showed the outbreaks had been contained.},

Although aquatic habitats utilized by wild and domestic birds potentially can provide a bridge for avian influenza virus (AIV) transmission among many diverse hosts, the factors controlling environmental persistence and transmission via these habitats are poorly understood. AIV has been detected in water samples collected in the field, and under experimental laboratory conditions, these viruses can remain infective in water for periods of time that would be consistent with an environmental reservoir. However, the application of laboratory results to field realities is complicated by the complexity and scale of these systems. In this brief review, we present a summary of existing research on the environmental tenacity of AIV, provide an example of the challenges associated with the application of laboratory results to the field realities associated with detection of AIV from environmental sources, and identify gaps in our current understanding of the factors potentially affecting AIV infectivity in the environment, specifically from aquatic habitats utilized by wild birds.},

	abstract = {Highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza (AI) (HPAI) is an extremely contagious, multi-organ systemic disease of poultry leading to high mortality, and caused by some H5 and H7 subtypes of type A influenza virus, family Orthomyxoviridae. However, most AI virus strains are mildly pathogenic (MP) and produce either subclinical infections or respiratory and/or reproductive diseases in a variety of domestic and wild bird species. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a List A disease of the Office International des Epizooties, while MPAI is neither a List A nor List B disease. Eighteen outbreaks of HPAI have been documented since the identification of AI virus as the cause of fowl plague in 1955. Mildly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are maintained in wild aquatic bird reservoirs, occasionally crossing over to domestic poultry and causing outbreaks of mild disease. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses do not have a recognised wild bird reservoir, but can occasionally be isolated from wild birds during outbreaks in domestic poultry. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been documented to arise from MPAI viruses through mutations in the haemagglutinin surface protein. Prevention of exposure to the virus and eradication are the accepted methods for dealing with HPAI. Control programmes, which imply allowing a low incidence of infection, are not an acceptable method for managing HPAI, but have been used during some outbreaks of MPAI. The components of a strategy to deal with MPAI or HPAI include surveillance and diagnosis, biosecurity, education, quarantine and depopulation. Vaccination has been used in some control and eradication programmes for AI.},

We used microsatellite markers to examine the population structures of two coexisting species of garter snake, Thamnophis elegans and Thamnophis sirtalis, to determine if shared landscape and biology imposed similar population genetic structures. These snakes inhabit a series of ponds, lakes and flooded meadows in northern California and tend to converge on prey type wherever they coexist. Both garter snakes had comparable effective population sizes and bidirectional migration rates (estimated using a maximum-likelihood method based on the coalescent) with low but significant levels of genetic differentiation (F(ST) = 0.024 for T. elegans and 0.035 for T. sirtalis). Asymmetrical gene flow revealed large source populations for both species as well as potential sinks, suggesting frequent extinction-recolonization and metapopulation dynamics. In addition, we found a significant correlation between their genetic structures based on both pairwise F(ST)s for shared populations (P = 0.009) and for bidirectional migration rates (P = 0.024). Possible ecological and evolutionary factors influencing similarities and differences in genetic structure for the two species are discussed. Genetic measures of effective population size and migration rates obtained in this study are also compared with estimates obtained from mark-recapture data.},

	abstract = {All natural populations fluctuate in abundance and age structure through time; understanding why they do so is a critical step towards their effective management and conservation. However, the long-term data sets needed for such an understanding are rarely available, especially for tropical organisms. A 17-year capturemark– recapture study yielded detailed information on the demography of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) and their main prey, the dusky rat (Rattus colletti), on the Adelaide River flood plain in tropical Australia. The link between annual rainfall patterns and rat demography was highly non-linear. Rat numbers were low during years with low and high rainfall at the end of the wet season (April). Numbers of both predators and prey fluctuated considerably among years. Annual fluctuations in rat numbers generated a corresponding variation in rates of female python reproduction, python body condition and survival. Although variation in recruitment, survival and prey abundance all had a significant impact on annual fluctuations in python numbers, our analyses suggest that recruitment constituted the main determinant in driving the population dynamics of these large tropical predators. In combination with our other studies on this system, the data show that population dynamics of the water python population is ultimately driven by annual variation in rainfall, mediated via shifts in prey availability. The water pythons and the dusky rats of the Adelaide River flood plain thus demonstrate an unusually clear and direct link between an abiotic factor (rainfall) and predator–prey population dynamics.},

Both species were common and widely distributed in the study region. Naja melanoleuca inhabited mainly primary and secondary forest patches, but also plantations and suburbia. The two species differed significantly in terms of habitat types frequented. A logistic regression model showed that the presence of N. melanoleuca was significantly influenced by the presence of a unique macrohabitat category (primary swamp-forest), whereas the presence or absence of N. nigricollis did not correlate with any macrohabitat categories. Aboveground activity of both species was lowest during the hottest months of the dry season (December to February) and peaked during the wettest months of the wet season (June and July). Sexual size dimorphism was minor in both species, but N. melanoleuca attained a significantly greater body size than N. nigricollis. The adult sex ratio was approximately 1:1 in both species. Both species preyed on a wide variety of small to medium-sized vertebrates; adult N. melanoleuca fed with similar frequency upon mammals, frogs, and fish, whereas the young fed mainly upon fish. Adult N. nigricollis preyed mainly on lizards and to a lesser degree on mammals and frogs, whereas the young preyed with similar frequency upon lizards, frogs, and fish. Many of the prey of both these cobra species were terrestrial (rodents and shrews), but semiaquatic (frogs) and aquatic (fish) prey were also frequently taken. In both N. melanoleuca and N. nigricollis, egg laying probably occurred over a broad time-span, there was a positive relationship between maternal size and litter size, and reproduction first occurred when individuals attained a low proportion of their maximum size},

	abstract = {It is well documented that pathogens can affect the survival, reproduction, and growth of individual plants. Drawing together insights from diverse studies in ecology and agriculture, we evaluate the evidence for pathogens affecting competitive interactions between plants of both the same and different species. Our objective is to explore the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of such interactions. First, we address how disease interacts with intraspecific competition and present a simple graphical model suggesting that diverse outcomes should be expected. We conclude that the presence of pathogens may have either large or minimal effects on population dynamics depending on many factors including the density-dependent compensatory ability of healthy plants and spatial patterns of infection. Second, we consider how disease can alter competitive abilities of genotypes, and thus may affect the genetic composition of populations. These genetic processes feed back on population dynamics given trade-offs between disease resistance and other fitness components. Third, we examine how the effect of disease on interspecific plant interactions may have potentially far-reaching effects on community composition. A host-specific pathogen, for example, may alter a competitive hierarchy that exists between host and non-host species. Generalist pathogens can also induce indirect competitive interactions between host species. We conclude by highlighting lacunae in our current understanding and suggest that future studies should (1) examine a broader taxonomic range of pathogens since work to date has largely focused on fungal pathogens; (2) increase the use of field competition studies; (3) follow interactions for multiple generations; (4) characterize density-dependent processes; and (5) quantify pathogen, as well as plant, population and community dynamics.},

Although urbanization reduces the abundance of many wildlife parasites, transmission can, in some cases, increase among urban-adapted hosts, with effects on rarer wildlife or those living beyond city limits. Continued rapid urbanization, together with risks posed by multi-host pathogens for humans and vulnerable wildlife populations, emphasize the need for future research on wildlife diseases in urban landscapes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Most forest species responded positively to forest extent, while felids in particular were sensitive to human population density. However, the effects of human density on patch occupancy operated at extremely local scales. Effects were stronger at a smaller grain size, offering optimistic prospects for conservation strategies that incorporate human population effects. Three arboreal frugivores (Ateles geoffroyi, Alouatta pigra, and Ramphastos sulfuratus) were strongly associated with total basal area of trees bearing fleshy fruits. The degree of hunting pressure was not related to human population density, and affected the occupancy probability of three game species, two of which (Mazama spp., Crax rubra) are among the most preferred prey across the Yucatán Peninsula. Levels of patch occupancy across this region varied considerably among species, and were best explained by body size and degree of forest habitat specificity, large-bodied species and habitat specialists being the most vulnerable. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the conservation potential of large vertebrates in Mesoamerica and identifies disturbance-sensitive species. This can inform regional-scale conservation planning at a time when low deforestation in parts of the Yucatán Peninsula still provides a narrow window of conservation opportunity given the rapid human population growth. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One puzzling aspect of this indirect interaction is the repeated rediscovery of the essential ideas. Apparent competition arises between focal and alternative prey populations because, in the long term, enemy abundance depends on total prey availability; by increasing enemy numbers, alternative prey intensify predation on focal prey. A frequent empirical finding, consistent with theory, is exclusion of victim species from local communities by resident enemies. Theory suggests victim-species coexistence depends on particular conditions. To understand fully the consequences of shared enemies requires a body of contingent theory, specifying the time-scale of the interactions (short? and long-term consequences of sharing enemies generally differ), the structure of the food-web encompassing the interactions, its spatial context, etc. The "core criterion" for a focal victim species to invade a community supporting a resident, polyphagous enemy is r{\textbackslash}textgreater aP (the invader's i},

	abstract = {The goal of ecology is to understand interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms. In principle, ecologists should be able to identify a small number of limiting resources for a species of interest, estimate densities of these resources at different locations across the landscape, and then use these estimates to predict the density of the focal species at these locations. In practice, however, development of functional relationships between abundances of species and their resources has proven extremely difficult, and examples of such predictive ability are very rare. Ecological studies of prey requirements of tigers Panthera tigris led us to develop a simple mechanistic model for predicting tiger density as a function of prey density. We tested our model using data from a landscape-scale long-term (1995-2003) field study that estimated tiger and prey densities in 11 ecologically diverse sites across India. We used field techniques and analytical methods that specifically addressed sampling and detectability, two issues that frequently present problems in macroecological studies of animal populations. Estimated densities of ungulate prey ranged between 5.3 and 63.8 animals per km2. Estimated tiger densities (3.2-16.8 tigers per 100 km2) were reasonably consistent with model predictions. The results provide evidence of a functional relationship between abundances of large carnivores and their prey under a wide range of ecological conditions. In addition to generating important insights into carnivore ecology and conservation, the study provides a potentially useful model for the rigorous conduct of macroecological science.},

	abstract = {To explore the impacts of increasing human numbers on nature, many studies have examined relationships between human population density (HPD) and biodiversity change. The implicit assumption in many of these studies is that as population density increases so does the threat to biodiversity. The implications of this assumption are compounded by recent research showing that species richness for many taxonomic groups is often highest in areas with high HPD. If increasing HPD is a threat to conservation, this threat may be magnified owing to the spatial congruence between people and species richness. Here, I review the relationships between HPD and measures of biodiversity status focussing in particular on evidence for the spatial congruence between people and species richness and the threat that increasing HPD may pose to biodiversity conservation. The review is split into two major sections: (i) a quantitative assessment of 85 studies covering 401 analyses, including meta-analyses on discrete relationships; and (ii) a discussion of the implications of the quantitative analyses and major issues raised in the literature.Our understanding of the relationships between HPD and biodiversity is skewed by geographic and taxonomic biases in the literature. Most research has been conducted in the Northern Hemisphere and focussed primarily on birds and mammals, largely ignoring relationships with other taxonomic groups. A total of 127 analyses compared HPD with the species richness of particular taxonomic groups. A meta-analysis of these results found a significant positive population correlation indicating that, on average, species-rich regions and human settlements co-occur. However, there was substantial unexplained heterogeneity in these data. Some of this heterogeneity was explained by the size of the sampling unit used by researchers – as this increased so did the strength of the correlation between HPD and species richness. The most convincing result for a taxonomic group was a significant positive population correlation between HPD and bird species richness. Significant positive population correlations were also found for HPD versus the richness of threatened and geographically restricted species. Hence, there is reasonably good evidence for spatial congruence between people and species-rich regions. The reasons for this congruence are only just beginning to be explored, but key mutual drivers appear to include available energy and elevation.The evidence for increasing HPD as a threat to conservation was weak, owing primarily to the extreme heterogeneity in the approaches used to address this issue. There was some suggestion of a positive relationship between HPD and species extinction, but this result should be interpreted with caution owing to the wide diversity of approaches used to measure extinction. Identifying strong links between human development and species extinction is hampered in part by the difficulty of recording extinction events. The most convincing indication of the negative impact of increasing HPD was a significant negative population correlation between density and the size of protected areas.The magnitude and implications of spatial congruence between people and biodiversity are now being explored using the principles of complementarity and irreplaceability. Human development as a threat to conservation is usually assessed within a complex, interdisciplinary modelling framework, although population size is still considered a key factor. Future population growth and expansion of human settlements will present increasing challenges for conserving species-rich regions and maximising the benefits humans gain from nature.},

	abstract = {Subsistence hunting affects vast tracts of tropical wilderness that otherwise remain structurally unal- tered, yet distinguishing hunted from nonhunted tropical forests presents a difficult problem because this diffuse form of resource extraction leaves few visible signs of its occurrence. I used a standardized series of line-transect censuses conducted over a 10-year period to examine the effects of subsistence game harvest on the structure of vertebrate communities in 25 Amazonian forest sites subjected to varying levels of hunting pressure. Crude verte- brate biomass, which was highly correlated with hunting pressure, gradually declined from nearly 1200 kg km ? 2 at nonhunted sites to less than 200 kg km ? 2 at heavily hunted sites. Hunting had a negative effect on the total biomass and relative abundance of vertebrate species in different size classes at these forest sites, but it did not af- fect their overall density. In particular, persistent hunting markedly reduced the density of large-bodied game spe- cies ({\textbackslash}textgreater5 kg), which contributed a large proportion of the overall community biomass at nonhunted sites (65– 78\%) and lightly hunted sites (55–71\%). Nutrient-rich floodplain forests contained a consistently greater game biomass than nutrient-poor unflooded forests, once I controlled for the effects of hunting pressure. Conservative estimates of game yields indicate that as many as 23.5 million game vertebrates, equivalent to 89,224 tons of bushmeat with a market value of US\$190.7 million, are consumed each year by the rural population of Brazil- ian Amazonia, which illustrates the enormous socioeconomic value of game resources in the region. My cross- site comparison documents the staggering effect of subsistence hunters on tropical forest vertebrate communities and highlights the importance of considering forest types and forest productivity in game management programs.},

The correlation turns from positive to negative below a study grain of c. 1 km and below a study extent of c. 10,000 km(2).

	abstract = {Abstract: The concept of the ecological trap, a low-quality habitat that animals prefer over other available habitats of higher quality, has appeared in the ecological literature irregularly for over 30 years, but the topic has received relatively little attention, and evidence for traps remains largely anecdotal. Recently, however, the ecological trap concept has been the subject of a flurry of theoretical activity that is likely to raise its profile substantially, particularly in conservation biology. Ecological trap theory suggests that, under most circumstances, the presence of a trap in a landscape will drive a local population to extinction. A number of empirical studies, almost all of birds, suggest the existence of traps and demonstrate the difficulties of recognizing them in the field. Evidence for ecological traps has primarily been found in habitats modified by human activities, either directly (e.g., through the mowing of grassland birds' nests) or indirectly (e.g., via human-mediated invasion of exotic species), but some studies suggest that traps may occur even in relatively pristine areas. Taken together, these theoretical and empirical results suggest that traps may be relatively common in rapidly changing landscapes. It is therefore important for conservation biologists to be able to identify traps and differentiate them from sinks. Commonly employed approaches for population modeling, which tend to assume a source-sink framework and do not consider habitat selection explicitly, may introduce faulty assumptions that mask the effects of ecological traps and lead to overly optimistic predictions about population persistence. Given the potentially dire consequences of ecological traps and the accumulating evidence for their existence, greater attention from the community of conservation biologists is warranted. In particular, it is important for conservation biologists and managers to incorporate into conservation planning an explicit understanding of the relationship between habitat selection and habitat quality. Resumen: El concepto de la trampa ecológica, hábitat de baja calidad que los animales prefieren por encima de otros hábitats disponibles, ha aparecido irregularmente en la literatura ecológica por más de 30 años, pero el tema ha recibido relativamente poca atención, y la evidencia sobre trampas es principalmente anecdótica. Sin embargo, el concepto de trampa ecológica recientemente ha sido sujeto de una agitada actividad teórica que probablemente eleve su perfil sustancialmente, particularmente en biología de la conservación. La teoría de la trampa ecológica sugiere que, bajo la mayoría de las circunstancias, la presencia de una trampa en un paisaje conducirá a una población local a la extinción. Numerosos estudios empíricos, casi todos de aves, sugieren la existencia de trampas y demuestran las dificultades para reconocerlas en el campo. La evidencia de trampas ecológicas ha sido encontrada principalmente en hábitats modificados por actividades humanas, ya sea directa (e.g. por siega de nidos de aves de pastizales) o indirectamente (e.g. por vía de invasiones de especies exóticas provocadas por humanos), pero algunos estudios sugieren que las trampas pueden ocurrir en áreas relativamente prístinas. En conjunto, estos resultados teóricos y empíricos sugieren que las trampas son relativamente comunes en paisajes con cambios rápidos. Por lo tanto, es importante que los biólogos de la conservación puedan identificar trampas y diferenciarlas de vertederos. Los métodos utilizados comúnmente para modelar poblaciones, que tienden a asumir un marco de fuente-vertedero y no consideran la selección hábitat explícitamente, pueden introducir suposiciones erróneas que enmascaran los efectos de las trampas ecológicas y conducen a predicciones demasiado optimistas acerca de la persistencia de la población. Dadas las consecuencias potencialmente desastrosas de las trampas ecológicas y la acumulación de evidencia de su existencia, se requiere una mayor atención por parte de la comunidad de biólogos de la conservación. Particularmente, es importante que los biólogos y los gestores de la conservación incorporen en la planificación de la conservación un entendimiento explícito de la relación entre selección de hábitat y calidad de hábitat.},

A single global model explained 27.3\% of variation in mammal extinction risk, but explanatory power was lower for region-specific models (median R2=0.248) and usually higher for taxon-specific models (median R2=0.383). Geographical range size, human population density and latitude were the most consistently significant predictors of extinction risk, but otherwise there was little evidence for general, prescriptive indicators of high extinction risk across mammals.

Predictive models remain elusive due to the complexity of host-parasite systems and insufficient data describing how environmental conditions affect various system components. Here, we link host-macroparasite models with the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, providing a mechanistic framework that allows integrating multiple nonlinear environmental effects to estimate parasite fitness under novel conditions. The models allow determining the fundamental thermal niche of a parasite, and thus, whether climate change leads to range contraction or may permit a range expansion. Applying the models to seasonal environments, and using an arctic nematode with an endotherm host for illustration, we show that climate warming can split a continuous spring-to-fall transmission season into two separate transmission seasons with altered timings. Although the models are strategic and most suitable to evaluate broad-scale patterns of climate change impacts, close correspondence between model predictions and empirical data indicates model applicability also at the species level. As the application of Metabolic Theory considerably aids the a priori estimation of model parameters, even in data-sparse systems, we suggest that the presented approach could provide a framework for understanding and predicting climatic impacts for many host-parasite systems worldwide.},

	abstract = {Defaunation, the loss or population decline of medium and large native vertebrates represents a significant threat to the biodiversity of tropical ecosystems. Here we review the anthropogenic drivers of defaunation, provide a brief historical account of the development of this field, and analyze the types of biological consequences of this impact on the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems. We identify how defaunation, operating at a variety of scales, from the plot to the global level, affects biological systems along a gradient of processes ranging from plant physiology (vegetative and reproductive performance) and animal behavior (movement, foraging and dietary patterns) in the immediate term; to plant population and community dynamics and structure leading to disruptions of ecosystem functioning (and thus degrading environmental services) in the short to medium term; to evolutionary changes (phenotypic changes and population genetic structure) in the long-term. We present such a synthesis as a preamble to a series of papers that provide a compilation of our current understanding of the impact and consequences of tropical defaunation. We close by identifying some of the most urgent needs and perspectives that warrant further study to improve our understanding of this field, as we confront the challenges of living in a defaunated world. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite the fact that effective treatment exists, i.e. administration of animal-derived antivenoms, the availability and accessibility of these life-saving immunobiologicals is deficitary in various parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and some regions of Asia. This article discusses some of the problems that need to be circumvented in order to improve the availability and accessibility of antivenoms. The conglomerate of antivenom manufacturers is highly heterogeneous in terms of technological base, qualification of staff, implementation of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs), and volume of production. Therefore, improvements in antivenom quality and availability should be based on strategies tailored to the situation of each region or country; in this context, three different scenarios are discussed. Accessibility of antivenoms demands concerted efforts at multiple levels, including raising the awareness of public health authorities on the relevance of the problem, implementing innovative antivenom purchasing schemes, strengthening national distribution channels on the basis of robust epidemiological information, improving the cold chain and the provision of health services in remote rural settings, supporting the correct use of antivenoms, and promoting the involvement of local community organizations in various aspects of prevention and management. These tasks should be envisaged in terms of synergistic, interprogrammatic and intersectorial interventions, with the participation of many players. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The ectothermic nature of snakes raises the issue of how climate change's impact on snake ecology could influence the incidence of snakebites in humans in ways that echo the increased predation pressure of snakes on their prey. We thus ask whether snakebites reported in Costa Rica from 2005 to 2013 were associated with meteorological fluctuations. We emphasize El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a climatic phenomenon associated with cycles of other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the region and elsewhere. We ask how spatial heterogeneity in snake-bites and poverty are associated, given the importance of the latter for NTDs. We found that periodicity in snakebites reflects snake reproductive phenology and is associated with ENSO. Snakebites are more likely to occur at high temperatures and may be significantly reduced after the rainy season. Nevertheless, snakebites cluster in Costa Rican areas with the heaviest rainfall, increase with poverty indicators, and decrease with altitude. Altogether, our results suggest that snakebites might vary as a result of climate change.},

	abstract = {Recent studies addressing broad-scale species richness gradients have proposed two main primary drivers: contemporary climate and evolutionary processes (differential balance between speciation and extinction). Here, we analyze the global richness patterns of two venomous snake clades, Viperidae and Elapidae. We used ordinary least squares multiple regression (OLS) and partial regression analysis to investigate to what extent actual evapotranspiration (AET; summarizing current environmental conditions) and biogeographical regions (representing evolutionary effects) were associated with species richness. For viperids, AET explained 45.6\% of the variance in richness whereas the effect of this variable for elapids was almost null (0.5\%). On the other hand, biogeographic regions were the best predictors of elapid richness (56.5\%), against its relatively small effect (25.9\%) in viperid richness. Partial regressions also revealed similar patterns for independent effects of climate and history in both clades. However, the independent historical effect in Elapidae decreased from 45.2 to 17.8\% when we excluded Australia from the analyses, indicating that the strong historical effect that had emerged for the global richness pattern was reflecting the historical process of elapid radiation into Australia. Even after excluding Australia, the historical signal in elapid richness in the rest of the globe was still significant and much higher than that observed in viperid richness at a global scale (2.7\% after controlling for AET effects). Differences in the evolutionary age of these two clades can be invoked to explain these contrasting results, in that viperids probably had more time for diversification, generating richness responses to environmental gradients, whereas the pattern of distribution of elapid richness can be more directly interpreted in an evolutionary context. Moreover, these results show the importance of starting to adopt deconstructive approaches to species richness, since the driving factors of these patterns may vary from group to group according to their evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) has attracted great interest because it proposes an explanation for species diversity gradients based on temperature-metabolism relationships of organisms. Here we analyse the spatial richness pattern of 73 coral snake species from the New World in the context of MTE. We first analysed the association between ln-transformed richness and environmental variables, including the inverse transformation of annual temperature (1/kT). We used eigenvector-based spatial filtering to remove the residual spatial autocorrelation in the data and geographically weighted regression to account for non-stationarity in data. In a model I regression (OLS), the observed slope between ln-richness and 1/kT was -0.626 (r2= 0.413), but a model II regression generated a much steeper slope (-0.975). When we added additional environmental correlates and the spatial filters in the OLS model, the R2increased to 0.863 and the partial regression coefficient of 1/kT was -0.676. The GWR detected highly significant non-stationarity, in data, and the median of local slopes of ln-richness against 1/kT was -0.38. Our results expose several problems regarding the assumptions needed to test MTE: although the slope of OLS fell within that predicted by the theory and the dataset complied with the assumption of temperature-independence of average body size, the fact that coral snakes consist of a restricted taxonomic group and the non-stationarity of slopes across geographical space makes MTE invalid to explain richness in this case. Also, it is clear that other ecological and historical factors are important drivers of species richness patterns and must be taken into account both in theoretical modeling and data analysis. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Themajority of diversity appears to derive froma radiationwithin the superfamily Colubroidea, potentially stemming fromthe colonization ofnew areas and the evolution of advanced venom-delivery systems. In contrast, negative relationships between clade age, clade size, and diversification rate suggest the potential for possible bias in estimated diversification rates, interpreted by some recent authors as support for ecologically mediated limits on diversity. However, evidence from the fossil record indicates that numerous lineages were far more diverse in the past, and that extinction has had an important impact on extant diversity patterns. Thus, failure to adequately account for extinction appears to prevent both rate- and diversity-limited models from fully characterizing richness dynamics in snakes.We suggest that clade-level extinctionmay provide a key mechanism for explaining negative or hump-shaped relationships between clade age and diversity, and the prevalence of ancient, species-poor lineages in numerous groups.},

	abstract = {The processes that drive the evolution of snake venom variability, particularly the role of diet, have been a topic of intense recent research interest. Here, we test whether extensive variation in venom composition in the medically important viper genus Echis is associated with shifts in diet. Examination of stomach and hindgut contents revealed extreme variation between the major clades of Echis in the proportion of arthropod prey consumed. The toxicity (median lethal dose, LD(50)) of representative Echis venoms to a natural scorpion prey species was found to be strongly associated with the degree of arthropod feeding. Mapping the results onto a novel Echis phylogeny generated from nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data revealed two independent instances of coevolution of venom toxicity and diet. Unlike venom LD(50), the speed with which venoms incapacitated and killed scorpions was not associated with the degree of arthropod feeding. The prey-specific venom toxicity of arthropod-feeding Echis may thus be adaptive primarily by reducing venom expenditure. Overall, our results provide strong evidence that variation in snake venom composition results from adaptive evolution driven by natural selection for different diets, and underscores the need for a multi-faceted, integrative approach to the study of the causes of venom evolution.},

Therefore, I examined latitudinal gradients in, and relationships between, species richness, geographic range size, and body size among 144 species of New World venomous snakes [families Elapidae (coral snakes) and Viperidae (pitvipers)]. Both lineages are monophyletic, collectively span 99° of latitude, and are extremely variable in body size and geographic range sizes. Coral snakes exhibit highest species richness near the equator, while pitviper species richness peaks in Central America. Species - range size distributions were strongly right-skewed for both families. There was little support for Bergmann's rule or Rapoport's rule for snakes of either family, as neither body size nor range size increased significantly with latitude. However, range area and median range latitude were positively correlated above 15° N, indicating a possible "Rapoport effect" at high northern latitudes. Geographic range size was positively associated with body size. Available continental area strongly influenced range size. Comparative (phylogenetically-based) analyses revealed that shared history is a poor predictor of range size variation within clades. Among vipers, trends in geographic range sizes may have been structured more by historical biogeography than by macroecological biotic factors.},

	abstract = {The immediate effects of environment on time-energy allocation decisions made by individuals determine long-term responses of individuals and populations to environmental variation. Low energy specialists, like vipers, are probably especially sensitive to environmental influences on bioenergetics. Because features of some species of vipers (e.g., large body size, dense populations, simple behaviors, ease of manipulation) facilitate the collection of detailed information on field bioenergetics and behavior, these animals have become excellent models for the study of causes and consequences of variation in time-energy allocation. Such studies have produced a mass of information that is difficult to integrate. I describe a simulation modeling approach that incorporates physiological and behavioral decisions and is capable of incorporating and integrating a great deal of complexity. Model sensitivity analysis demonstrates that small variations in body temperature, food availability, metabolism, and digestive performance may have significant effects on growth, size, and reproduction. Furthermore, this physiologically structured simulation provides insights regarding possible mechanisms that underlie important ecological and evolutionary phenomena such as geographic patterns in growth and size, patterns in direction and degree of sexual size dimorphism, as well as patterns in reproductive effort (e.g., long inter-litter intervals). Perhaps most important, simulation models entrain our intuition about how viper populations work, and clarify the limits of our empirical and theoretical understanding of the relationship between fundamental behavioral and physiological mechanisms and their population ecology.},

Whereas snake-related dreams (SRDs) are reported and associated with real-life events of snake sightings and killings, the rarer occurrence of actual snakebite is not generally linked in public discourse with an SRD. The informational limits of SRDs and events are defined by one's network of cognatic and affinal kinsmen. A dream about a snakebite survivor camouflages the true identity of the person linked to one's frustration over a thwarted expectation.

We calculated extinction rates in two ways: first, by incorporating the known sequence of historical island separations and second by ignoring history and assuming that the islands became isolated simultaneously. The second procedure is simpler and more frequently used in the literature and produces estimates of extinction rates that are similar to the first, more complex procedure. We then determined the relationship between extinction rates (calculated using both methods) and body mass, longevity, habitat specialization, and population abundance using two methods: first, by accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among species and, second, by ignoring them. Only population abundance and habitat specialization explained a significant amount of the observed variation in species extinction rates. Body mass itself did not explain variation in extinction rates, although it was strongly correlated with abundance. These conclusions were obtained using both procedures for calculating extinction rates and both procedures for correlating extinction rates with life-history traits.},

The SCM involved a patient-held record, a project coordinator, routine contact between the patient and general practitioner/primary care physician, and primary care physician education. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer, and an empowerment questionnaire before, in the middle of, and on completion of chemotherapy. The presence and severity of adverse effects of chemotherapy were recorded by patients in a symptom diary. RESULTS: Ninety-seven eligible participants were randomly allocated, less than half the intended recruitment. There were no significant differences between the groups for empowerment, symptom prevalence, or Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scores. The proportion with clinical anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety score of {\textbackslash}textgreater/= 11) decreased over time in both groups (P = .013) but decreased more in the intervention group (P = .002). Depression was unchanged over time. CONCLUSION: Our study was limited by low recruitment and predominance of patients with breast cancer, and was underpowered for the main analyses. Results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Little benefit was seen for SCM in the majority of domains including empowerment, symptom prevalence, and psychological adjustment to cancer. The SCM showed efficacy in clinically anxious patients. Such interventions may be better implemented by using a targeted approach to identify at-need subgroups.},

Convincing examples of neofunctionalization, however, remain rare. Snake venom phospholipase A2 genes are members of large multigene families with many diverse functions, thus they are excellent models to study the emergence of novel functions after gene duplications.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Here, I show that positive Darwinian selection and neofunctionalization is common in snake venom phospholipase A2 genes. The pattern of gene duplication and positive selection indicates that adaptive molecular evolution occurs immediately after duplication events as novel functions emerge and continues as gene families diversify and are refined. Surprisingly, adaptive evolution of group-I phospholipases in elapids is also associated with speciation events, suggesting adaptation of the phospholipase arsenal to novel prey species after niche shifts. Mapping the location of sites under positive selection onto the crystal structure of phospholipase A2 identified regions evolving under diversifying selection are located on the molecular surface and are likely protein-protein interactions sites essential for toxin functions.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nCONCLUSION: These data show that increases in genomic complexity (through gene duplications) can lead to phenotypic complexity (venom composition) and that positive Darwinian selection is a common evolutionary force in snake venoms. Finally, regions identified under selection on the surface of phospholipase A2 enzymes are potential candidate sites for structure based antivenin design.},

Here I examine montane gradients in reptile species richness with separate analyses of snakes and lizards from mountains around the world to assess a predominant temperature effect and three additional theories of diversity, including a temperature-water effect, the species-area effect and the mid-domain effect (MDE). Location Twenty-five elevational gradients of reptile diversity from temperate, tropical and desert mountains in both hemispheres, spanning 10.3 degrees N to 46.1 degrees N. Methods Elevational gradients in reptile diversity are based on data from the literature. Of the 63 data sets found or compiled, only those with a high, unbiased sampling effort were used in analyses. Twelve predictions and three interactions of diversity theory were tested using nonparametric statistics, linear regressions and multiple regression with the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results Reptile richness and, individually, snake and lizard richness on mountains followed four distinct patterns: decreasing, low-elevation plateaus, low-elevation plateaus with mid-elevation peaks, and mid-elevation peaks. Elevational reptile richness was most strongly correlated with temperature. The temperature effect was mediated by precipitation; reptile richness was more strongly tied to temperature on wet gradients than on arid gradients. Area was a secondary factor of importance, whereas the MDE was not strongly associated with reptile diversity on mountains. Main conclusions Reptile diversity patterns on mountains did not follow the predicted temperature-water effect, as all diversity patterns were found on both wet and dry mountains. But the influence of precipitation on the temperature effect most likely reflects reptiles' use of radiant heat sources (sunning opportunities) that are more widespread on arid mountains than wet mountains due to lower humidity, sparser vegetation and less cloud cover across low and intermediate elevations.},

Southest Asia is a network of islands with relatively few mountains, effectively preventing most herpetofauna from migrating away from the effects of climate change. Reflecting specific known and hypothesized physiological and ecological thresholds, we estimate that in\${\textbackslash}backslash\$50 years, amphibians and reptiles in Southeast Asia will have reached or exceeded most limits in their abilities to adapt to the effects of climate change and that temperature dependent sex determination, higher metabolic rates, and less bio-available water will have severe and irreversible effects on these organisms.

	abstract = {Despite increasing concern over the possible impact of global temperature change, there is little empirical evidence of direct temperature effects on biotic interactions in natural systems. Clear assessment of the ecological and evolutionary impact of changing climatic temperature requires a natural system in which populations exhibit a direct unambiguous fitness response to thermal fluctuation. I monitored nests of a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination to investigate the causal relationship between local climatic variation in temperature and offspring sex ratio. Consistent with theoretical predictions, annual offspring sex ratio was highly correlated with mean July air temperature, validating concerns about the effect of climate change on population demography. This correlation implies that even modest increases in mean temperature ({\textbackslash}textless 2 degrees C) may drastically skew the sex ratio. Statistical evaluation of the variance in climate change indicates that an increase in mean temperature of 4 degrees C would effectively eliminate production of male offspring. Quantitative genetic analyses and behavioral data suggest that populations with temperature-dependent sex determination may be unable to evolve rapidly enough to counteract the negative fitness consequences of rapid global temperature change. Populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may serve as ideal indicators of the biological impact of global temperature change.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim We explore the relationship between current European distributions of amphibian and reptile species and observed climate, and project species potential distributions into the future. Potential impacts of climate warming are assessed by quantifying the magnitude and direction of modelled distributional shifts for every species. In particular we ask, first, what proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to lose and gain suitable climate space in the future? Secondly, do species projections vary according to taxonomic, spatial or environmental properties? And thirdly, what climate factors might be driving projections of loss or gain in suitable environments for species? Location Europe. Methods Distributions of species are modelled with four species-climate envelope techniques (artificial neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and classification tree analyses) and distributions are projected into the future using five climate-change scenarios for 2050. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have unlimited dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A novel hybrid approach for combining ensembles of forecasts is then used to group linearly covarying projections into clusters with reduced inter-model variability. Results We show that a great proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to expand distributions if dispersal is unlimited. This is because warming in the cooler northern ranges of species creates new opportunities for colonization. If species are unable to disperse, then most species are projected to lose range. Loss of suitable climate space for species is projected to occur mainly in the south-west of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula, whilst species in the south-east are projected to gain suitable climate. This is because dry conditions in the south-west are projected to increase, approaching the levels found in North Africa, where few amphibian species are able to persist. Main conclusions The impact of increasing temperatures on amphibian and reptile species may be less deleterious than previously postulated; indeed, climate cooling would be more deleterious for the persistence of amphibian and reptile species than warming. The ability of species to cope with climate warming may, however, be offset by projected decreases in the availability of water. This should be particularly true for amphibians. Limited dispersal ability may further increase the vulnerability of amphibians and reptiles to changes in climate},

Reports linking snakebite vulnerability to socioeconomic status are usually limited to anecdotal statements. The few reports with a global perspective have identified the tropical regions of Asia and Africa as suffering the highest levels of snakebite-induced mortality. Our analysis examined the association between globally available data on snakebite-induced mortality and socioeconomic indicators of poverty. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We acquired data on (i) the Human Development Index, (ii) the Per Capita Government Expenditure on Health, (iii) the Percentage Labour Force in Agriculture and (iv) Gross Domestic Product Per Capita from publicly available databases on the 138 countries for which snakebite-induced mortality rates have recently been estimated. The socioeconomic datasets were then plotted against the snakebite-induced mortality estimates (where both datasets were available) and the relationship determined. Each analysis illustrated a strong association between snakebite-induced mortality and poverty. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This study, the first of its kind, unequivocally demonstrates that snake envenoming is a disease of the poor. The negative association between snakebite deaths and government expenditure on health confirms that the burden of mortality is highest in those countries least able to deal with the considerable financial cost of snakebite.},

	abstract = {Human infectious diseases are a significant threat to global human health and economies (e.g. Ebola, SARs), with the majority of infectious diseases having an animal source (zoonotic). Despite their importance, the lack of a quantitative predictive framework hampers our understanding of how spillovers of zoonotic infectious diseases into the human population will be impacted by global environmental stressors. Here, we create an environmental-mechanistic model for understanding the impact of global change on the probability of zoonotic disease reservoir host–human spillover events. As a case study, we focus on Lassa fever virus (LAS). We first quantify the spatial determinants of LAS outbreaks, including the phylogeographic distribution of its reservoir host Natal multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) (LAS host). Secondly, we use these determinants to inform our environmental-mechanistic model to estimate present-day LAS spillover events and the predicted impact of climate change, human population growth and land use by 2070. We find phylogeographic evidence to suggest that LAS is confined to only one clade of LAS host (Western clade Mastomys natalensis) and that the probability of its occurrence was a major determinant of the spatial variation in LAS historical outbreaks (69·8\%), along with human population density (20·4\%). Our estimates for present-day LAS spillover events from our environmental-mechanistic model were consistent with observed patterns, and we predict an increase in events per year by 2070 from 195 125 to 406 725 within the LAS endemic western African region. Of the component drivers, climate change and human population growth are predicted to have the largest effects by increasing landscape suitability for the host and human–host contact rates, while land-use change has only a weak impact on the number of future events. LAS spillover events did not respond uniformly to global environmental stressors, and we suggest that understanding the impact of global change on zoonotic infectious disease emergence requires an understanding of how reservoir host species respond to environmental change. Our environmental-mechanistic modelling methodology provides a novel generalizable framework to understand the impact of global change on the spillover of zoonotic diseases.},

	abstract = {"Emerging" infectious diseases can be defined as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range. Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (a foodborne infection caused by certain strains of Escherichia coli). Specific factors precipitating disease emergence can be identified in virtually all cases. These include ecological, environmental, or demographic factors that place people at increased contact with a previously unfamiliar microbe or its natural host or promote dissemination. These factors are increasing in prevalence; this increase, together with the ongoing evolution of viral and microbial variants and selection for drug resistance, suggests that infections will continue to emerge and probably increase and emphasizes the urgent need for effective surveillance and control. Dr. David Satcher's article and this overview inaugurate Perspectives, a regular section in this journal intended to present and develop unifying concepts and strategies for considering emerging infections and their underlying factors. The editors welcome, as contributions to the Perspectives section, overviews, syntheses, and case studies that shed light on how and why infections emerge, and how they may be anticipated and prevented.},

The association of EVD outbreaks with forest clearance has been suggested previously but many aspects remained uncharacterized. We used remote sensing techniques to investigate the association between deforestation in time and space, with EVD outbreaks in Central and West Africa. Favorability modeling, centered on 27 EVD outbreak sites and 280 comparable control sites, revealed that outbreaks located along the limits of the rainforest biome were significantly associated with forest losses within the previous 2 years. This association was strongest for closed forests ({\textbackslash}textgreater83\%), both intact and disturbed, of a range of tree heights (5–{\textbackslash}textgreater19 m). Our results suggest that the increased probability of an EVD outbreak occurring in a site is linked to recent deforestation events, and that preventing the loss of forests could reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK provides an ideal opportunity to explore optimal control measures for an infectious disease. The presence of fine-scale spatio-temporal data for the 2001 epidemic has allowed the development of epidemiological models that are more accurate than those generally created for other epidemics and provide the opportunity to explore a variety of alternative control measures. Vaccination was not used during the 2001 epidemic; however, the recent DEFRA (Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs) contingency plan details how reactive vaccination would be considered in future. Here, using the data from the 2001 epidemic, we consider the optimal deployment of limited vaccination capacity in a complex heterogeneous environment. We use a model of FMD spread to investigate the optimal deployment of reactive ring vaccination of cattle constrained by logistical resources. The predicted optimal ring size is highly dependent upon logistical constraints but is more robust to epidemiological parameters. Other ways of targeting reactive vaccination can significantly reduce the epidemic size; in particular, ignoring the order in which infections are reported and vaccinating those farms closest to any previously reported case can substantially reduce the epidemic. This strategy has the advantage that it rapidly targets new foci of infection and that determining an optimal ring size is unnecessary.},

Extensive cytogenetic work has suggested that the level of sex chromosome heteromorphism varies among species, with Boidae having entirely homomorphic sex chromosomes, Viperidae having completely heteromorphic sex chromosomes, and Colubridae showing partial differentiation. Here, we take a genomic approach to compare sex chromosome differentiation in these three snake families. We identify homomorphic sex chromosomes in boas (Boidae), but completely heteromorphic sex chromosomes in both garter snakes (Colubridae) and pygmy rattlesnake (Viperidae). Detection of W-linked gametologs enables us to establish the presence of evolutionary strata on garter and pygmy rattlesnake sex chromosomes where recombination was abolished at different time points. Sequence analysis shows that all strata are shared between pygmy rattlesnake and garter snake, i.e., recombination was abolished between the sex chromosomes before the two lineages diverged. The sex-biased transmission of the Z and its hemizygosity in females can impact patterns of molecular evolution, and we show that rates of evolution for Z-linked genes are increased relative to their pseudoautosomal homologs, both at synonymous and amino acid sites (even after controlling for mutational biases). This demonstrates that mutation rates are male-biased in snakes (male-driven evolution), but also supports faster-Z evolution due to differential selective effects on the Z. Finally, we perform a transcriptome analysis in boa and pygmy rattlesnake to establish baseline levels of sex-biased expression in homomorphic sex chromosomes, and show that heteromorphic ZW chromosomes in rattlesnakes lack chromosome-wide dosage compensation. Our study provides the first full scale overview of the evolution of snake sex chromosomes at the genomic level, thus greatly expanding our knowledge of reptilian and vertebrate sex chromosomes evolution.},

	abstract = {The Concho Water Snake (Nerodia harteri paucimaculata) is confined to the Concho-Colorado River valley of central Texas, thereby occupying one of the smallest geographic ranges of any North American snake. On 1986, N. h. paucimaculata was designated as a federally threatened species, in large part because of reservoir projects that were perceived to adversely affect the amount of habitat available to the snake. During a ten-year period (1987-1996), we conducted capture-recapture field studies to assess dynamics of five subpopulations of snakes in both natural (river) and man-made (reservoir) habitats. Because of differential sampling of subpopulations, we present separate results for all five subpopulations combined (including large reservoirs) and three of the five subpopulations (excluding large reservoirs). We used multistate capture-recapture models to deal with stochastic transitions between pre-reproductive and reproductive size classes and to allow for the possibility of different survival and capture probabilities for the two classes. We also estimated both the finite rate of increase (lambda) for a deterministic, stage-based, female-only matrix model using the average litter size, and the average rate of adult population change, (lambda) over cap, which describes changes in numbers of adult snakes, using a direct capture-recapture approach to estimation. Average annual adult survival was about 0.23 and similar for males and females. Average annual survival for subadults was about 0.14. The parameter estimates from the stage-based projection matrix analysis all yielded asymptotic values of lambda = 1.26, Si((lambda) over cap) = 0.18 and (lambda) over cap = 0.99, S (E) over cap((lambda) over cap) = 0.79, based on two different models. Thus, the direct estimation approach did not provide strong evidence of population declines of the riverine subpopulations, but the estimates are characterized by substantial uncertainty.},

	abstract = {The composition of snake venoms shows a high degree of variation at all taxonomic levels, and natural selection for diet has been implicated as a potential cause. Saw-scaled vipers (Echis) provide a good model for studying this phenomenon. The venoms of arthropod feeding species of Echis are significantly more toxic to natural scorpion prey than those of species which feed predominantly upon vertebrate prey. Although testing venom activity on natural prey is important for our understanding of the evolution of venom, natural prey species are often difficult to obtain in sufficient numbers for toxinological work. In order to test the viability of using cheaper and more easily available model organisms for toxicity assessments in evolutionary research, and the extent to which toxicity of arthropod-eating Echis venoms is increased to arthropods in general or targeted to certain groups, we conducted median lethal dosage (LD50) and time to death trials using the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) as a model arthropod, rarely consumed by wild Echis. The venoms of arthropod specialist Echis were found to be significantly more toxic to locusts than the venom of a vertebrate feeding outgroup (Bitis arietans), and one arthropod specialist venom was found to be more toxic than those species which feed upon arthropods infrequently or not at all. The venoms of arthropod specialists were also found to cause death and incapacitation faster than the vertebrate feeding outgroup. Despite some similarity of trends, there are considerable differences between the response of natural prey (scorpions) and a model arthropod (locust) to the venoms of Echis species. This suggests that when possible, natural prey rather than convenient model organisms should be used to gain an understanding of the functional significance of variation in venom composition in snakes. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Venomous snakebite and its effects are a source of fear for people living in southern Nepal. As a result, people have developed a negative attitude towards snakes, which can lead to human-snake conflicts that result in killing of snakes. Attempting to kill snakes increases the risk of snakebite, and actual killing of snakes contributes to loss of biodiversity. Currently, snake populations in southern Nepal are thought to be declining, but more research is needed to evaluate the conservation status of snakes. Therefore, we assessed attitudes, knowledge, and awareness of snakes and snakebite by Chitwan National Park's (CNP) buffer zone (BZ) inhabitants in an effort to better understand challenges to snake conservation and snakebite management. The results of this study have the potential to promote biodiversity conservation and increase human health in southern Nepal and beyond. We carried out face-to-face interviews of 150 randomly selected CNP BZ inhabitants, adopting a cross-sectional mixed research design and structured and semi-structured questionnaires from January–February 2013. Results indicated that 43 \% of respondents disliked snakes, 49 \% would exterminate all venomous snakes, and 86 \% feared snakes. Farmers were the most negative and teachers were the most ambivalent towards snakes. Respondents were generally unable to identify different snake species, and were almost completely unaware of the need of conserve snakes and how to prevent snakebites. Belief in a snake god, and the ability of snakes to absorb poisonous gases from the atmosphere were among many superstitions that appeared to predispose negativity towards snakes of BZ residents. People with predisposed negativity towards snakes were not proponents of snake conservation. Fear, negativity, ambivalence towards, and ignorance about, snakes and the need for snake conservation were strong indicators of the propensity to harm or kill snakes. It seems that if wanton killing of snakes continues, local snake populations will decline, and rare and endangered snake species may even become locally extirpated. Moreover, inappropriate perception and knowledge about snakes and snakebites may put BZ people at increased risk of venomous snakebite. Therefore, intensive, pragmatic educational efforts focused on natural history and ecology of snakes and prevention of snakebite should be undertaken in communities and at schools and universities.},

	abstract = {Human–wildlife conflict is one of the most critical threats facing many wildlife species today, and the topic is receiving increasing attention from conservation biologists. Direct wildlife damage is commonly cited as the main driver of conflict, and many tools exist for reducing such damage. However, significant conflict often remains even after damage has been reduced, suggesting that conflict requires novel, comprehensive approaches for long-term resolution. Although most mitigation studies investigate only the technical aspects of conflict reduction, peoples' attitudes towards wildlife are complex, with social factors as diverse as religious affiliation, ethnicity and cultural beliefs all shaping conflict intensity. Moreover, human–wildlife conflicts are often manifestations of underlying human–human conflicts, such as between authorities and local people, or between people of different cultural backgrounds. Despite evidence that social factors can be more important in driving conflict than wildlife damage incurred, they are often ignored in conflict studies. Developing a broader awareness of conflict drivers will advance understanding of the patterns and underlying processes behind this critical conservation issue. In this paper, I review a wide variety of case studies to show how social factors strongly influence perceptions of human–wildlife conflict, and highlight how mitigation approaches should become increasingly innovative and interdisciplinary in order to enable people to move from conflict towards coexistence.},

We suggest that we should distinguish between human–wildlife impacts and human–human conflicts and be explicit about the different interests involved in conflict.

The data was recorded from September to November 2006 by means of open-ended interviews performed with 74 individuals of both genders, whose ages ranged from 4 to 89 years old. The results show that the local terms biting, stinging and pricking are synonymous and used as equivalent to offending. All these terms mean to attack. A total of 23 types of 'snakes' were recorded, based on their local names. Four of them are Viperidae, which were considered the most dangerous to humans, besides causing more aversion and fear in the population. In general, local people have strong negative behavior towards snakes, killing them whenever possible. Until the antivenom was present and available, the locals used only charms, prayers and homemade remedies to treat or protect themselves and others from snake bites. Nowadays, people do not pay attention to these things because, basically, the antivenom is now easily obtained at regional hospitals. It is understood that the ethnozoological knowledge, customs and popular practices of the Pedra Branca inhabitants result in a valuable cultural resource which should be considered in every discussion regarding public health, sanitation and practices of traditional medicine, as well as in faunistic studies and conservation strategies for local biological diversity.},

In this study we use two case studies to explore how people's perceptions of primates are often influenced by these animals' apparent similarity to humans, creating expectations, founded within a "human morality" about how primates should interact with people. When animals transgress these social rules, they are measured against the same moral framework as humans. This has implications for how people view and respond to certain kinds of primate behaviors, their willingness to tolerate co-existence with primates and their likely support for primate conservation initiatives.},

Most available studies reported the use of direct services from reptiles and indirect services from amphibians. Although eight ecosystem services were identified, most studies focused on reptiles as seed dispersers and protein sources. Biological pest control and bioturbation were the most widely studied services obtained from amphibians.

Whereas snake-related dreams (SRDs) are reported and associated with real-life events of snake sightings and killings, the rarer occurrence of actual snakebite is not generally linked in public discourse with an SRD. The informational limits of SRDs and events are defined by one's network of cognatic and affinal kinsmen. A dream about a snakebite survivor camouflages the true identity of the person linked to one's frustration over a thwarted expectation. SRDs are reported only when their manifest content is auspicious and appears relevant to the day's activities. (PsycLIT Database Copyright 1992 American Psychological Assn, all rights reserved)},

PPARdelta displays strong expression in tissues with high lipid metabolism, such as adipose, intestine and muscle. Its role in skeletal muscle remains largely unknown. After a 24-h starvation period, PPARdelta mRNA levels are dramatically up-regulated in gastrocnemius muscle of mice and restored to control level upon refeeding. The rise of PPARdelta is accompanied by parallel up-regulations of fatty acid translocase/CD36 (FAT/CD36) and heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP), while refeeding promotes down-regulation of both genes. To directly access the role of PPARdelta in muscle cells, we forced its expression and that of a dominant-negative PPARdelta mutant in C2C12 myogenic cells. Differentiated C2C12 cells responds to 2-bromopalmitate or synthetic PPARdelta agonist by induction of genes involved in lipid metabolism and increment of fatty acid oxidation. Overexpression of PPARdelta enhanced these cellular responses, whereas expression of the dominant-negative mutant exerts opposite effects. These data strongly support a role for PPARdelta in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and in adaptive response of this tissue to lipid catabolism.},

	abstract = {Marburg virus (family Filoviridae) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Bats have been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in 2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40,000 R. aegyptiacus were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present. Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1,622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated ∼2.5\% of the bats were actively infected, seven of which yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for R. aegyptiacus tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (∼six months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83\% (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of two tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with R. aegyptiacus bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges. These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg hemorrhagic fever risk reduction strategies.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) was first described in 1994 in an outbreak of acute and highly lethal disease in horses and humans in Australia. Equine cases continue to be diagnosed periodically, yet the predisposing factors for infection remain unclear. We undertook an analysis of equine submissions tested for HeV by the Queensland government veterinary reference laboratory over a 20-year period to identify and investigate any patterns. We found a marked increase in testing from July 2008, primarily reflecting a broadening of the HeV clinical case definition. Peaks in submissions for testing, and visitations to the Government HeV website, were associated with reported equine incidents. Significantly differing between-year HeV detection rates in north and south Queensland suggest a fundamental difference in risk exposure between the two regions. The statistical association between HeV detection and stockhorse type may suggest that husbandry is a more important risk determinant than breed per se . The detection of HeV in horses with neither neurological nor respiratory signs poses a risk management challenge for attending veterinarians and laboratory staff, reinforcing animal health authority recommendations that appropriate risk management strategies be employed for all sick horses, and by anyone handling sick horses or associated biological samples.},

	abstract = {1. Equids are generalist herbivores that co-exist with bovids of similar body size in many ecosystems. There are two major hypotheses to explain their co-existence, but few comparative data are available to test them. The first postulates that the very different functioning of their digestive tracts leads to fundamentally different patterns of use of grasses of different fibre contents. The second postulates resource partitioning through the use of different plant species. As domestic horses and cattle are used widely in Europe for the management of conservation areas, particularly in wetlands, a good knowledge of their foraging behaviour and comparative nutrition is necessary. 2. In this paper we describe resource-use by horses and cattle in complementary studies in two French wetlands. Horses used marshes intensively during the warmer seasons. both species used grasslands intensively throughout the year; cattle used forbs and shrubs much more than horses. Niche breadth was similar and overlap was high (Kulczinski's index 0.58-0.77). Horses spent much more time feeding on short grass than cattle. These results from the two sites indicate strong potential for competition. 3. Comparative daily food intake. measured in the field during this study for the first time, was 63\% higher in horses (144 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)) than in cattle (88 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)). Digestibility of the cattle diets was a little higher. but daily intake of digestible dry matter (i.e. nutrient extraction) in all seasons was considerably higher in horses (78 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day (-1)) than in cattle (51 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)). When food is limiting. horses should outcompete cattle in habitats dominated by grasses because their functional response is steeper: under these circumstances cattle will require an ecological refuge for survival during winter, woodland or shrubland with abundant dicotyledons. 4. Horses are a good tool for plant management because they remove more vegetation per unit body weight than cattle. and use the most productive plant communities and plant species (especially graminoids) to a greater extent. They feed closer to the ground, and maintain a mosaic of patches of short and tall grass that contributes to structural diversity at this scale. Cattle use broadleaved plants to a greater extent than horses, and can reduce the rate of encroachment by certain woody species.},

Since the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) H5N1 have caused many outbreaks in poultries and wild birds from East Asia and have spread to at least 48 countries. For such a fast and wide-spreading virulent pathogen, prediction based on changes of micro- and macro-environment has rarely been evaluated. In this study, we are developing a new climatic approach by investigating the conditions that occurred before the H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks for early predicting future HPAI outbreaks and preventing pandemic disasters. The results show a temperature drop shortly before these outbreaks in birds in each of the Eurasian regions stricken in 2005 and 2006. Dust storms, like those that struck near China's Lake Qinghai around May 4, 2005, exacerbated the spread of this HPAI H5N1 virus, causing the deaths of a record number of wild birds and triggering the subsequent spread of H5N1. Weather monitoring could play an important role in the early warning of outbreaks of this potentially dangerous virus.},

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5×0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

Moreover, the layered landscape epidemiology surrounding spillover from reservoir host species to humans is ill-defined. Identifying landscape features that contribute to NiV spillover would likely prove helpful in preventing emergence in human populations. Methods: Using an inhomogeneous Poisson model, this study investigated the role of vegetation cover, the human footprint (HFP) and reservoir Pteropus bat distribution to identify the spatial dependence of spillover and map risk across South and Southeast Asia. Results: The spatial model identified HFP (RR=1.08; 95\% CI 1.05–1.11) and bat distribution (RR=19.44; 95\% CI 1.92–196.7) as significant predictors of NiV risk, while vegetation cover was not significant after accounting for HFP and the presence of Pteropus bats. Conclusions: These findings further inform the landscape epidemiology of NiV and suggest specific conduits for spillover in the landscape. However, more detailed field studies will be required to validate these results.},

The mares ate large quantities of forage (21.9 +/- 2.4 kg of organic matter per day, i.e. 166.2 +/- 20.8 g of organic matter per kg LW0.75 per day) in comparison with previous published values and with the estimated requirements of these horses. The use of the vegetation was very selective, the mares spent about 70\% of their feeding time on short grass lawns (sward surface less than or equal to 4 cm, biomass {\textbackslash}textless100 g.m(-2)), that represented only 10\% of the area. This behaviour maintained the plants at young growing stages which are of better quality than ungrazed plants. These results are discussed in relation to the dynamics of the plant communities.},

	abstract = {Foraging herbivores are often faced with spatial and temporal heterogeneity within the vegetation they have available to graze and therefore have to make decisions where and when to graze. The study reported in this paper investigated the influence of sward height on diet selection by horses grazing perennial rye-grass swards. The study comprised two experiments. In Experiment 1, perennial rye-grass paddocks were mown to four sward heights (heights: 3.5, 4.5, 7.5 and 15 cm) to create a patchy environment. Within each paddock one horse grazed for a period of 1 h during which residence time, number of bites and frequency of visits per patch were recorded. This was replicated with all seven horses used in the experiment. The same experiment was repeated in Experiment 2, but without mowing the field and allowing 1 week of re-growth for each paddock. During both experiments horses entered equally often but resided significantly longer on patches with long grass (15 cm) than on those with short grass (below 4.5 cm; P {\textbackslash}textless0.05). Grazing time and number of bites on a patch were highly correlated. The number of bites on patches with the highest sward height was greater than that on short patches (P {\textbackslash}textless0.05). Horses behaved as selective grazers, feeding mainly on grass taller than 7 cm. In Experiment 2, re-growth of the sward reduced the difference in sward height between the patches. Time spent per patch and total numbers of bites taken were less affected by sward height than in Experiment 1. It is suggested that horses behaved as energy maximisers (residing longer periods on patches and increasing number of bites taken). These data complement previous findings that bite dimension and bite mass increase with increasing sward height. When grazing, a horse rarely resided on a preferred patch for a long duration of time (maximum 305 s, median 79 s), but moved on after a few minutes. They sampled their environment continuously, but almost exclusively returned to long patches for feeding. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

	abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) are increasingly used to link the dynamics of individuals to higher levels of biological organization. Still, many IBMs are data hungry, species specific, and time-consuming to develop and analyze. Many of these issues would be resolved by using general theories of individual dynamics as the basis for IBMs. While such theories have frequently been examined at the individual level, few cross-level tests exist that also try to predict population dynamics. Here we performed a cross-level test of dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory by parameterizing an individual-based model using individual-level data of the water flea, Daphnia magna, and comparing the emerging population dynamics to independent data from population experiments. We found that DEB theory successfully predicted population growth rates and peak densities but failed to capture the decline phase. Further assumptions on food-dependent mortality of juveniles were needed to capture the population dynamics after the initial population peak. The resulting model then predicted, without further calibration, characteristic switches between small- and large-amplitude cycles, which have been observed for Daphnia. We conclude that cross-level tests help detect gaps in current individual-level theories and ultimately will lead to theory development and the establishment of a generic basis for individual-based models and ecology.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus, first identified in 1994 in Queensland, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen gaining importance in Australia because a growing number of infections are reported in horses and people. The virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae (genus Henipavirus), is transmitted to horses by pteropid bats (fruit bats or flying foxes), with human infection a result of direct contact with infected horses. Case-fatality rate is high in both horses and people, and so far, more than 60 horses and four people have died from Hendra virus infection in Australia. Human infection is characterised by an acute encephalitic syndrome or relapsing encephalitis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Recent identification of Hendra virus infection in a domestic animal outside the laboratory setting, and the large range of pteropid bats in Australia, underpins the potential of this virus to cause greater morbidity and mortality in both rural and urban populations and its importance to both veterinary and human health. Attempts at treatment with ribavirin and chloroquine have been unsuccessful. Education, hygiene, and infection control measures have hitherto been the mainstay of prevention, while access to monoclonal antibody treatment and development of an animal vaccine offer further opportunities for disease prevention and control. ©2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels-especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour-is essential for making the science predictive. 'Pattern-oriented modelling' (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.},

	abstract = {Summary 1. Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3. When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4. Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10 000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques.},

It is found to be generally superior if diurnal forcing is present and very much superior to the use of the insulated surface assumption. An analogous method of predicting ground surface moisture content is presented which allows the surface to become moist quickly during rainfall or to become drier than the bulk soil while evaporation occurs. These improved methods are not of much relevance unless the main influences of a vegetation layer are included. An efficient one-layer foliage parameterization is therefore developed that extends continuously from the case of no shielding of the ground by vegetation to complete shielding. It includes influences of both ground and foliage albedos and emissivlties, net leaf area index, stomatal resistance, retained water on the foliage, and several other considerations. When it is tested against data for wheat measured by Penman and Long (1960), it appears quite adequate despite the many simplifying assumptions. The parameterization predicts that errors of up to a factor of 2 in evapotranspiration can be incurred by ignoring the presence of a vegetation layer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.},

Además, se realiza un análisis al nivel de polígono sobre la dinámica de las superficies forestales con vegetación secundaria, con la finalidad de establecer si se trata de un proceso de recuperación o de alteración forestal. Los resultados encontrados demuestran que las tasas de cambio han disminuido en el periodo 2000-2007, pero que la superficie forestal disminuye anualmente en alrededor de 500 000 ha. Para el periodo 1976-2007, se encontró una pérdida anual de 534 707 ha. Los datos oficiales de deforestación muestran una subvaluación a partir de 2006, ya que se descuenta 100\% de la superficie ocupada por vegetación secundaria, cuando en la realidad el proceso de recuperación es de entre 10\% y 13\% de dicha superficie. Con el dato ajustado del proceso de recuperación se recalcularon las cifras oficiales publicadas a partir de 2006, mostrando consistencia en relación con la estabilización de la superficie anual deforestada.

We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from 'true zero' or 'false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

This paper examines the causes and consequences of seasonality, and in so doing derives several new results concerning vaccination strategy and the interpretation of disease outbreak data. It begins with a brief review of published scientific studies in support of different causes of seasonality in infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R0, disease outbreaks, endemic dynamics and persistence. Finally, a mathematical analysis of routine and pulse vaccination programmes for seasonal infections is presented.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Every year West African countries within the Sahelo-Sudanian band are afflicted with major meningococcal meningitis (MCM) disease outbreaks, which affect up to 200,000 people, mainly young children, in one of the world's poorest regions. The timing of the epidemic year, which starts in February and ends in late May, and the spatial distribution of disease cases throughout the "Meningitis Belt" strongly indicate a close linkage between the life cycle of the causative agent of MCM and climate variability. However, mechanisms responsible for the observed patterns are still not clearly identified. METHODS AND FINDINGS: By comparing the information on cases and deaths of MCM from World Health Organization weekly reports with atmospheric datasets, we quantified the relationship between the seasonal occurrence of MCM in Mali, a West African country, and large-scale atmospheric circulation. Regional atmospheric indexes based on surface wind speed show a clear link between population dynamics of the disease and climate: the onset of epidemics and the winter maximum defined by the atmospheric index share the same mean week (sixth week of the year; standard deviation, 2 wk) and are highly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first that provides a clear, quantitative demonstration of the connections that exist between MCM epidemics and regional climate variability in Africa. Moreover, this statistically robust explanation of the MCM dynamics enables the development of an Early Warning Index for meningitis epidemic onset in West Africa. The development of such an index will undoubtedly help nationwide and international public health institutions and policy makers to better control MCM disease within the so-called westward-eastward pan-African Meningitis Belt.},

	abstract = {In contrast to horses in pastures, it is thought that free-ranging horses do not perform latrine behaviour, i.e. a behavioural pattern whereby the animals graze and defecate in separate areas. However, few studies deal with this particular subject, reporting contrasting conclusions. We hypothesize that horses free-ranging in large heterogeneous areas do not perform latrine behaviour. Thus, we believe that grazing and elimination behaviour are spatially related: where horses graze, they will also defecate. Behavioural data were collected from Konik horses, Haflinger horses, Shetland ponies and donkeys, grazing in different nature reserves (54-80ha). Data for the different equids were analyzed separately, as well as data for mares and stallions (Konik and donkey stallions only). We investigated the proportion of the number of defecations/urinations while grazing on the total number of defecations/ urinations; furthermore, we searched for the sequence of behaviours representing latrine behaviour in the strict sense. Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between grazing behaviour and eliminative behaviour on both vegetation type level and patch level. All the female equids often continued grazing while defecating. During urination, grazing ceases in the majority of instances. Cases where a mare terminated grazing in a certain vegetation type and sward height to eliminate in another vegetation type or in another sward height within the same vegetation type were rarely observed. On the vegetation type level as well as on the patch level, there was a highly significant (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001) positive correlation between grazing time and number of eliminations (or eliminating time). The high values of the correlation coefficients (in case of the defecation variables r ranges between 0.553 and 0.955; in case of the urination variables r ranges between 0.370 and 0.839) illustrate that the spatial distribution of the eliminative behaviour can be explained to a high degree by the spatial distribution of the grazing behaviour. Results in the case of the stallions are preliminary, but indicate the same pattern. Horses, free-ranging in large heterogeneous areas, do not perform latrine behaviour, but defecate where they graze. Possibly, animal density is of major importance to explain this behavioural difference with horses in pastures. We suggest that also spatial vegetation heterogeneity and plant productivity of the grazed area, as well as parasite status of the grazing animals could play a role. ©2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are classified as threatened in Canada, and the Little Smoky herd in west-central Alberta is at immediate risk of extirpation due in part, to anthropogenic activities such as oil, gas, and forestry that have altered the ecosystem dynamics. Winter season represents an especially challenging time of year for this Holarctic species as it is characterized by a shortage of basic resources and is when most industrial development occurs, to which caribou can perceive as increased predation risk. To investigate the impact of industrial features on caribou, we developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioral mechanisms caribou are most likely to employ when navigating their landscape in winter. The ABM model is composed of cognitive caribou agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and predator/disturbance avoidance. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a virtual grid representing the landscape in terms of forage availability, energy content, and predation-risk. The model was calibrated with caribou bio-energetic values from literature sources, and validated using GPS data from thirteen caribou radio-collars deployed over 6 months from 2004 to 2005. Simulations were conducted on alternative caribou habitat-selection strategies by assigning different fitness-maximizing goals to agents. The model outcomes were evaluated using a pattern-oriented modeling approach with actual caribou data. The scenario in which the caribou agent must trade off the mutually competing goals of obtaining its daily energy requirement, conserving reproductive energy, and minimizing predation risk, was found to be the best-fit scenario. Not recognizing industrial features as risk causes simulated caribou to unrealistically reduce their daily and landscape movements; equally, having risk take precedence results in unrealistic energetic deficits and large-scale movement patterns, unlike those observed in actual caribou. These results elucidate the most likely behavioral strategies caribou use to select their winter habitat, the relative extent to which they perceive industry features as potential predation, and the differential energetic costs associated with each strategy. They can assist future studies of how caribou may respond to continued industrial development and/or mitigation measures. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sows housed under conditions of food and physical restriction often perform behaviours indicative of poor welfare (e.g. repetitive chain chewing), one cause of which may be the inability of sows to express foraging behaviour under confined conditions. The objective of this experiment was to measure the effect on behaviour of providing six gilts with a foraging device (The 'Edinburgh Foodball' British Patent No. 9200499.3) which was designed to deliver small food rewards, relatively randomly in space, time and quantity, in response to being rooted. The following treatments were sequentially applied: Baseline (B) (2.0 kg of standard sow diet given on the floor and no Foodball), Foodball (Fb) (2.0 kg floor fed; Foodball containing 5.0 kg), Extinction (E) (2.0 kg floor fed; Foodball without food) and Food (Fd) (2.0 kg floor fed; plus matched amount of food during Fb tests). Testing began at 08:30 h when gilts were floor fed, videoing continued between 09:00 and 17:00 h. On the Fb treatment gilts obtained a mean of 2608 g (s.e.m. 257) food in a mean of 112.8 min (s.e.m. 15.8), indicating that gilts fed a commercial size ration were still highly food motivated. The results showed that foraging activities were not significantly different for treatments B, Fb and E, but were significantly lower on Fd. This shows that it is not food level per se that determines foraging activity, but also the method of food presentation. On the Fb treatment pigs walked for more observations than on other treatments. Also on the Fb treatment straw directed behaviour appeared to be replaced by Foodball directed behaviour. The 'Edinburgh Foodball' appears to be a useful device in allowing gilts to express foraging behaviour. ?? 1994.},

We illustrate a number of improvements to MAXENT that follow from these relations. In particular, a point process model approach facilitates methods for choosing the appropriate spatial resolution, assessing model adequacy, and choosing the LASSO penalty parameter, all currently unavailable to MAXENT. The equivalence result represents a significant step in the unification of the species distribution modeling literature.},

In this paper, we describe and evaluate a model-based approach to accounting for observer bias directly - by modelling presence locations as a function of known observer bias variables (such as accessibility variables) in addition to environmental variables, then conditioning on a common level of bias to make predictions of species occurrence free of such observer bias. We implement this idea using point process models with a LASSO penalty, a new presence-only method related to maximum entropy modelling, that implicitly addresses the "pseudo-absence problem" of where to locate pseudo-absences (and how many). The proposed method of bias-correction is evaluated using systematically collected presence/absence data for 62 plant species endemic to the Blue Mountains near Sydney, Australia. It is shown that modelling and controlling for observer bias significantly improves the accuracy of predictions made using presence-only data, and usually improves predictions as compared to pseudo-absence or "inventory" methods of bias correction based on absences from non-target species. Future research will consider the potential for improving the proposed bias-correction approach by estimating the observer bias simultaneously across multiple species.},

When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6\%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3\%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.},

Certain conditions, such as provision of supplementary hay and lack of available herbage, can cause these behaviour patterns to change, although it is not known how to manipulate the grazing behaviour of horses to prevent deterioration of the pasture. Grazing behaviour is influenced by many variables and is more complex than the feeding behaviour of a stabled horse. Horses sleep for approximately 12\% of the day and show 4 different sleep/wakefulness states - alert wakefulness, drowsiness, slow-wave sleep and paradoxical sleep. Horses are able to maintain slow-wave sleep while standing, but they need to lie down for paradoxical sleep to occur, rarely spending more than 30 consecutive minutes in lateral recumbency. ?? 1983.},

	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

	abstract = {Australian Rain forests are given the status of three formations: Tropical, Subtropical and Temperate (including Cool and Warm facies). These terms follow established usage but connote properties of the vegetation without climatic implications. The boundaries of eastern Australian Subtropical Rain forest, which is coastal or subcoastal, are defined ecologically as approx. 21⚬ S. near Sarina, north Queensland, and 35⚬ S. near Kiama, southern New South Wales. Temperate Rain forest elements are patchily distributed at increasing altitudes from Tasmania (lat. 43⚬ S.) to north Queensland (lat. 16⚬ S.). The Rain forest formations are classified into twelve possible subformations on the basis of exclusively physiognomic and structural features, which include leaf size; height and continuity of tree layers; proportion of evergreen, semi-evergreen, deciduous or araucarian emergents; and prominence of special life forms such as woody lianes and mossy epiphytes. Subtropical Rain forest, under optimal conditions, is characterized by small mesophyll leaf sizes (2025-4500 sq. mm). It is proposed that `notophyll', as an addition to the Raunkiaer system, be used to denote this characteristic leaf size class. Physiognomic nomenclature is used for the subformations to avoid the ambiguities of climatic terms, and is conveniently abbreviated to symbols. Tropical Rain forest includes Mesophyll Vine forest (symbol MVF), Semi-evergreen Vine forest (SEVF), Deciduous Vine thicket (DVT) and probably other subformations. Subtropical Rain forest comprises Notophyll Vine forest (NVF), Araucarian Vine forest (AVF), Araucarian (Microphyll Vine woodland (MVW) and Semi-evergreen Vine thicket (SEVT). Warm Temperate Rain forest embraces Simple Mesophyll Vine forest (SMVF) and Simple Notophyll Vine forest (SNVF) which are essentially Lower Montane or Montane forms. Cool Temperate Rain forest includes Microphyll Mossy forest (MMF) and Microphyll Mossy thicket (MMT), which are also largely Montane. The nomenclature of forest, woodland and thicket follows definitions by Beard and Fanshawe. The series of subformations within each formation are broadly correlated with gradients of temperature (altitude or latitude), soil properties (moisture, drainage, fertility) and exposure. The sharp ecological segregation of Rain forests from the autochthonous sclerophyll flora is closely related to soil nutrient status (influenced by fire) as well as to temperature and moisture conditions and historical f{\textbackslash}ldots},

We analysed characteristics of Pteropus giganteus roosts and constructed an ecological niche model to identify suitable habitat in Bangladesh. We also assessed the distribution of suitable habitat in relation to the location of human Nipah virus cases. 3. Compared to non-roost trees, P. giganteus roost trees are taller with larger diameters, and are more frequently canopy trees. Colony size was larger in densely forested regions and smaller in flood-affected areas. Roosts were located in areas with lower annual precipitation and higher human population density than non-roost sites. 4. We predicted that 2-17\% of Bangladesh's land area is suitable roosting habitat. Nipah virus outbreak villages were 2.6 times more likely to be located in areas predicted as highly suitable habitat for P. giganteus compared to non-outbreak villages. 5. Synthesis and applications. Habitat suitability modelling may help identify previously undocumented Nipah outbreak locations and improve our understanding of Nipah virus ecology by highlighting regions where there is suitable bat habitat but no reported human Nipah virus. Conservation and public health education is a key component of P. giganteus management in Bangladesh due to the general misunderstanding and fear of bats that are a reservoir of Nipah virus. Affiliation between Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and people is common throughout their range, and in order to conserve these keystone bat species and prevent emergence of zoonotic viruses, it is imperative that we continue to improve our understanding of Pteropus resource requirements and routes of virus transmission from bats to people. Results presented here can be utilized to develop land management strategies and conservation policies that simultaneously protect fruit bats and public health.},

	abstract = {Management of grazed grasslands for production and/or conservation objectives requires a thorough understanding of the choices of feeding sites by herbivores, and of the biological processes involved. Most models of the feeding strategies of herbivores are based on the principle that optimising the intake of energy (or some nutrient) is the primary goal of foragers but other selective forces, such as parasitism, could be important. Gastrointestinal parasites (including cyathostome nematodes) have powerful effects on the fitness of herbivores and may act as a major selection pressure favouring host behaviour that reduces the risk of encountering parasites. Among large herbivores, horses have perhaps the most marked tendency to select particular feeding sites within grasslands. We test here: (1) whether horses select feeding patches with relatively low parasite densities and (2) if their choice is affected by their parasite load. We used 10 two-year old saddle-horses and three periods. In the first period, the horses were under natural parasitism which varied strongly among individuals; in the second period they were all dewormed, and in the third, a sub-set of the horses was experimentally infected with cyathostome larvae. Ninety-eight percent of the infective larvae in the pasture were found {\textbackslash}textless1 m from faeces. The main determinant of the choice of feeding patch by horses was the availability of patches of different parasite risk and grass height. Controlling for availability, the horses used tall grasses ({\textbackslash}textgreater16 cm) less than expected, whether the grass was contaminated or not, and they selected for short patches {\textbackslash}textgreater1 m from faeces, where the risk of encountering parasites was low. These results suggest that selection of feeding sites by horses is driven by an interaction between their nutritional and anti-parasite strategies: the horses avoid the patches of tall grass which are generally of low quality and areas contaminated by parasite larvae which leads them to prefer the patches of short grass far from faeces. The parasite status of the horses at the time of the experiment had no effect on their feeding choices. However, before concluding that the challenge by cyathostomes has no effect on the selection of feeding sites in horses, it will be necessary to test whether the history of parasitism of the individuals, rather than the current status, is important. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Much research in landscape ecology makes use of spatial models to define species-habitat associations. The early years of landscape ecology necessarily focused on the evolution of effective data sources, metrics, and statistical approaches that could truly capture the spatial and temporal patterns and processes of interest. Now that these tools are well established, we reflect in this volume on the ecological theories that underpin the assumptions commonly made during species distribution modeling and mapping. This is crucial for applying models to questions of global sustainability. This book will offer a unique perspective on modeling within the discipline of landscape ecology, which complements that of other recent publications. Through chapters that focus on particular aspects of modeling, illustrative case studies, and surveys of the field of modeling, this book illustrates that we can (and need to) pay attention to the foundational ecological theories and assumptions which support model development. We show how this can be done in modeling through theory, traditional inference, and predictions. Chapter authors have attempted to critically identify, evaluate, and even formally test these ecological theories and have also written thoughtful reflections on the state of landscape-scale species/habitat modeling. Predictive Species and Habitat Modeling in Landscape Ecology: Concepts and Applications is intended to be useful to researchers in landscape ecology, as well as those in conservation biology, wildlife management, population and community ecology, and general ecology. The book will be a valuable resource for graduate students incorporating landscape ecology and/or species modeling in their degree programs. About the Editors C.

We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale.

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46\% since the start of human civilization.},

Horse owners were contacted via horse magazines, social media Web sites, and horse industry councils and invited to complete an online survey. Information was collected on location, husbandry, and feeding management of their horse(s), pasture conditions, the observation of specified behaviors and forage selection by their horse(s) at pasture. The survey had 497 respondents across Australia who owned a total of 3,082 horses. Most horses (85\%) had access to grazing areas 16-24hours per day. Owners commonly (90\%) observed ???1 pasture problems on their property, and the mean number of problems was similar across grazing areas of {\textbackslash}textless2, 2-10, and {\textbackslash}textgreater10ha. Although the horses had access to pasture, there was a heavy reliance on supplementary feeding. Approximately 95\% of the horses were fed concentrates and/or supplements on a daily basis, and 86\% of the horses were offered conserved forage. Surveyed behaviors were reported by 75\% of the respondents, with bark chewing and licking or eating dirt being the most prevalent behaviors. Almost three-quarters of the horse owners indicated that their horses browse on parts of trees, shrubs, or other nonpasture species. This study verifies that Australian horses consume a range of nonpasture species and frequently demonstrate bark-chewing behavior while at pasture. It is currently unclear if the selections of browse and bark stripping observed in this study are a function of reduced pasture availability or vegetation diversity and diet choices.},

This requires ensembles of multi-decadal simulations to assess both chaotic climate variability and model response uncertainty. Statistical estimates of model response uncertainty, based on observations of recent climate change, admit climate sensitivities–defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide–substantially greater than 5 K. But such strong responses are not used in ranges for future climate change because they have not been seen in general circulation models. Here we present results from the 'climateprediction.net' experiment, the first multi-thousand-member grand ensemble of simulations using a general circulation model and thereby explicitly resolving regional details. We find model versions as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models but with climate sensitivities ranging from less than 2 K to more than 11 K. Models with such extreme sensitivities are critical for the study of the full range of possible responses of the climate system to rising greenhouse gas levels, and for assessing the risks associated with specific targets for stabilizing these levels.},

	abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of grasslands determines the abundance and quality of food resources for grazing animals. As plants mature, they increase in mass, which allows greater instantaneous intake rates, but the cell wall concentrations increase too, reducing diet quality. In ruminants, daily intake rates are often constrained by the time needed for the ingesta to pass through the rumen, which is influenced by the rate of digestion. It has been suggested that the digestive constraint should have much less effect on hindgut fermenters such as equids. Horses play an increasing role in the management of grasslands in Europe, but the data on the influence of the heterogeneity of the vegetation on their daily intake and foraging behaviour are sparse. We report here the results of a preliminary study concerning the effects of sward structure on nutrient assimilation and the use of patches of different heights by horses grazing successively a short immature, a tall mature and a heterogeneous pastures (with short and tall swards). Daily nutrient assimilation was higher in the heterogeneous pasture compared to the short (+35\%) and the tall (+55\%) ones. The digestive constraints may have limited voluntary intake by horses on the tall swards. In the heterogeneous pasture, the mean height used for feeding (6 to 7 cm) by horses was intermediate between the heights used in the short (4 to 5 cm) and tall pastures (22 to 23 cm), and the animals may thus have benefited from both short swards of high quality and tall swards offering a higher instantaneous intake rate.},

The per capita incidence of dengue was lower in Ho Chi Minh City than in most rural provinces; an- nual epidemics occurred 1–3 months later in Ho Chi Minh City than elsewhere. The timing and the magnitude of an- nual epidemics were significantly more correlated in nearby districts than in remote districts, suggesting that local bio- logical and ecologic drivers operate at a scale of 50–100 km.

	abstract = {Foraging behaviour (grazing time, diet selection) and overlap in vegetation use between five beef cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 does, suckling their offspring born in late winter-early spring, was compared across the grazing season (May-December). Animals were managed in mixed grazing on heather-gorse vegetation communities with an adjacent area (24\%) of ryegrass-clover improved pasture. Equines spent more daily time grazing than the other species in all seasons, averaging 610. min/day compared to 530, 481 and 496. min/day spent by cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. Seasonal changes in both grazing behaviour and diet selection were observed. Generally, cows, mares and ewes spent most of their grazing time on the improved pasture (0.77, 0.73 and 0.59, respectively), whereas goats spent more time grazing on shrublands (0.70). All species concentrated their diurnal grazing activity in the morning and late afternoon, whilst resting occurred mainly in the middle of the day. Herbaceous species were the main component in the diets of cattle, equines and sheep across the whole grazing season, whereas for goats this predominance was only observed during the spring. Cattle, sheep and equines turned to browse only when pasture availability decreased. Cattle and sheep tended to select heather in moderate amounts whereas they avoided gorse across the grazing season. By contrast, horses seemed to be able to deal with the gorse spiny shoots and consumed it in the autumn (averaging 0.29). The goats' diet at the end of the grazing season was mainly composed of heather species, reaching 0.81 in November. Degree of grazing overlap between livestock species was influenced by the animal species and also varied across the grazing season. The greatest similarity indexes (KSI) based on grazing time and diet composition data were found between cattle and equines (0.86) and between cattle and sheep (0.94), whereas the combination of goats with the other animal species resulted in lower KSI values. Dietary overlap decreased as the improved pasture availability decreased during the grazing season. Results suggest that the success of management strategies (type and composition of the flock, mixed or sequential, continuous or seasonal) in these heterogeneous vegetation conditions will depend on plant species characteristics and its proportions. Grazing management options should be based on production (animal performance) or environmental goals (biodiversity, control of shrub encroachment, reduction of fire risk, etc.) previously defined. Goats proved to be the best complement to the other animal species for an efficient use of natural vegetation. Nevertheless, studies should be carried out to assess the interactions between grazing behaviour and animal performance in these particular vegetation conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Mapping disease transmission risk is crucial in public and animal health for evidence based decision-making. Ecology and epidemiology are highly related disciplines that may contribute to improvements in mapping disease, which can be used to answer health related questions. Ecological niche modeling is increasingly used for understanding the biogeography of diseases in plants, animals, and humans. However, epidemiological applications of niche modeling approaches for disease mapping can fail to generate robust study designs, producing incomplete or incorrect inferences. This manuscript is an overview of the history and conceptual bases behind ecological niche modeling, specifically as applied to epidemiology and public health; it does not pretend to be an exhaustive and detailed description of ecological niche modeling literature and methods. Instead, this review includes selected state-of-the-science approaches and tools, providing a short guide to designing studies incorporating information on the type and quality of the input data (i.e., occurrences and environmental variables), identification and justification of the extent of the study area, and encourages users to explore and test diverse algorithms for more informed conclusions. We provide a friendly introduction to the field of disease biogeography presenting an updated guide for researchers looking to use ecological niche modeling for disease mapping. We anticipate that ecological niche modeling will soon be a critical tool for epidemiologists aiming to map disease transmission risk, forecast disease distribution under climate change scenarios, and identify landscape factors triggering outbreaks.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components, as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality costs, and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I demonstrate two important ways in which transmission modes can affect virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples, including one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two effects interact, and it need not hold in general.},

Forty adult horses (4 to 13 years) were used, ten from each of four different genetic groups (English thoroughbred, Brazilian showjumper, crossbred and Breton). The traits examined included heart and breathing rate, rectal temperature as well as blood parameters. The data underwent multivariate statistical analysis including cluster, discriminate and canonical using Statistical Analysis System - SAS (R) procedures CLUSTER, STEPDISC, CANCORR and DISCRIM. The tree diagram showed clear distances between groups studied and canonical analysis was able to separate individuals in groups. The discriminate analysis identified the variables which were most important in separating these groups.

	abstract = {As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate, understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important. Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some “hotspots” of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option.},

This opens promising perspectives for understanding how an animal perceives and reacts to the multi-scale structure of its environment. Yet, conceptual issues such as confusion between movement scales and searching modes prevent us from properly inferring the movement processes at different scales. Here, I propose to build on stationarity (i.e. stability of statistical parameters) to develop a consistent theoretical framework in which animal movements are modelled as a generic composite multi-scale multi-mode random walk model. This framework makes it possible to highlight scales that are relevant to the studied animal, the nature of the behavioural processes that operate at each of these different scales, and the way in which the processes involved at any given scale can interact with those operating at smaller or larger scales. This explicitly scale-focused approach should help properly analyse actual movements by relating, for each scale and each mode, the values of the main model parameters (speed, short- and long-term persistences, degree of stochasticity) to the animal's needs and skills and its response to its environment at multiple scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim Environmental niche models that utilize presence-only data have been increasingly employed to model species distributions and test ecological and evolutionary predictions. The ideal method for evaluating the accuracy of a niche model is to train a model with one dataset and then test model predictions against an independent dataset. However, a truly independent dataset is often not available, and instead random subsets of the total data are used for ‘training' and ‘testing' purposes. The goal of this study was to determine how spatially autocorrelated sampling affects measures of niche model accuracy when using subsets of a larger dataset for accuracy evaluation. Location The distribution of Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed; Asteraceae) was modelled in six states in the western United States: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. Methods Two types of niche modelling algorithms – the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction (GARP) and maximum entropy modelling (as implemented with Maxent) – were used to model the potential distribution of C. maculosa across the region. The effect of spatially autocorrelated sampling was examined by applying a spatial filter to the presence-only data (to reduce autocorrelation) and then comparing predictions made using the spatial filter with those using a random subset of the data, equal in sample size to the filtered data. Results The accuracy of predictions from both algorithms was sensitive to the spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort in the occurrence data. Spatial filtering led to lower values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve plot but higher similarity statistic (I) values when compared with predictions from models built with random subsets of the total data, meaning that spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between training and test data led to inflated measures of accuracy. Main conclusions The findings indicate that care should be taken when interpreting the results from presence-only niche models when training and test data have been randomly partitioned but occurrence data were non-randomly sampled (in a spatially autocorrelated manner). The higher accuracies obtained without the spatial filter are a result of spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between training and test data inflating measures of prediction accuracy. If independently surveyed data for testing predictions are unavailable, then it may be necessary to explicitly account for the spatial autocorrelation of sampling effort between randomly partitioned training and test subsets when evaluating niche model predictions.},

Previous research has shown that higher temperatures led to lower virus survival rates in the laboratory. We develop a model of survival of HeV in the environment as influenced by temperature. We used 20 years of daily temperature at six locations spanning the geographic range of reported HeV incidents to simulate the temporal and spatial impacts of temperature on HeV survival. At any location, simulated virus survival was greater in winter than in summer, and in any month of the year, survival was higher in higher latitudes. At any location, year-to-year variation in virus survival 24 h post-excretion was substantial and was as large as the difference between locations. Survival was higher in microhabitats with lower than ambient temperature, and when environmental exposure was shorter. The within-year pattern of virus survival mirrored the cumulative within-year occurrence of reported HeV cases, although there were no overall differences in survival in HeV case years and non-case years. The model examines the effect of temperature in isolation; actual virus survivability will reflect the effect of additional environmental factors.},

	abstract = {The numbers of horses grazing at pasture are increasing in developed countries, so a proper understanding of their feeding selectivity and of the tactics they use for extracting nutrients from swards is essential for the management of horses and grasslands. Resource acquisition in herbivores can be optimised through the modulation of their intake and patch selection, both being strongly dependent on the characteristics of swards. However, the principles by which horses adjust their grazing behaviour in response to variations in sward features are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether the behaviour of horses conforms to optimal foraging models. We hypothesized that, faced with binary choices between vegetative swards of a good and similar quality at three different heights, horses would select the taller sward, i.e. that allowing a higher reward in terms of dry matter intake rate. Three groups of three 2-year-old saddle horses were grazed on a semi-natural pasture that was managed to produce three contrasting sward heights at 6, 11 and 17 cm, in a Latin-square design. The instantaneous intake rate was determined from bite rate measured at pasture on the three sward heights, and bite mass estimated from measurements using swards offered indoors in experimental trays. Daily dry matter intake was estimated individually by total faecal collection and an estimation of digestibility from faecal nitrogen. Short-term (first 30 min) and daily preferences were assessed from the time spent grazing each sward offered in pair-wise tests at pasture. The results show that daily voluntary intake (an average of 21 g DM kg LW-1 day-1) and total grazing time (an average of 14 h day-1) were independent of sward height and of the choice of patches offered. In choice situations, the animals spent more time grazing on the taller sward, both during the first 30 min and at the daily scale. These results show that horses choose between vegetative patches of a good and similar quality according to the predictions from optimal foraging models, and select the one that they can ingest faster. Further research will now have to explore how the horses will adapt their feeding behaviour when they face a trade-off between sward height and quality. ©2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most spiders use venom to paralyze their prey and are commonly feared for their potential to cause injury to humans. In North America, one species in particular, Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider, Sicariidae), causes the majority of necrotic wounds induced by the Araneae. However, its distributional limitations are poorly understood and, as a result, medical professionals routinely misdiagnose brown recluse bites outside endemic areas, confusing putative spider bites for other serious conditions. To address the issue of brown recluse distribution, we employ ecological niche modeling to investigate the present and future distributional potential of this species. We delineate range boundaries and demonstrate that under future climate change scenarios, the spider's distribution may expand northward, invading previously unaffected regions of the USA. At present, the spider's range is centered in the USA, from Kansas east to Kentucky and from southern Iowa south to Louisiana. Newly influenced areas may include parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These results illustrate a potential negative consequence of climate change on humans and will aid medical professionals in proper bite identification/treatment, potentially reducing bite misdiagnoses.},

	abstract = {This study employs spatial filtering of occurrence data with the aim of reducing overfitting to sampling bias in ecological niche models (ENMs). Sampling bias in geographic space leads to localities that may also be biased in environmental space. If so, the model can overfit to those biases. As a preliminary test addressing this issue, we used Maxent, bioclimatic variables, and occurrence localities of a broadly distributed Malagasy tenrec, Microgale cowani (Tenrecidae: Oryzorictinae). We modeled the abiotically suitable area of this species using three distinct datasets: unfiltered, spatially filtered, and rarefied unfiltered localities. To quantify overfitting and model performance, we calculated evaluation AUC, the difference between calibration and evaluation AUC (=AUCdiff), and omission rates. Models made with the filtered dataset showed lower overfitting and better performance than the other two suites of models, having lower omission rates and AUCdiff, and a higher AUCevaluation. Additionally, the rarefied unfiltered dataset performed better than the unfiltered one for three evaluation metrics, likely because the larger one reinforced the biases. These results indicate that spatial filtering of occurrence localities may allow biogeographers to produce better models. ©2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.},

Here, we use ecological niche modelling to map the current potential distribution of the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), in Africa, and to estimate how future changes in climate and population could affect its spread and burden across the continent. We used 508 community-specific infection presence data collated from the published literature in conjunction with five predictive environmental/climatic and demographic variables, and a maximum entropy niche modelling method to construct the first ecological niche maps describing potential distribution and burden of LF in Africa. We also ran the best-fit model against climate projections made by the HADCM3 and CCCMA models for 2050 under A2a and B2a scenarios to simulate the likely distribution of LF under future climate and population changes. We predict a broad geographic distribution of LF in Africa extending from the west to the east across the middle region of the continent, with high probabilities of occurrence in the Western Africa compared to large areas of medium probability interspersed with smaller areas of high probability in Central and Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. We uncovered complex relationships between predictor ecological niche variables and the probability of LF occurrence. We show for the first time that predicted climate change and population growth will expand both the range and risk of LF infection (and ultimately disease) in an endemic region. We estimate that populations at risk to LF may range from 543 and 804 million currently, and that this could rise to between 1.65 to 1.86 billion in the future depending on the climate scenario used and thresholds applied to signify infection presence.},

Uncertainty in SDM output occurs due to differences among alternate models, species characteristics and scenarios of future climate. While considerable effort is being devoted to identifying and quantifying the first two sources of variation, a greater understanding of climate scenarios and how they affect SDM output is also needed. Climate models are complex tools: variability occurs among alternate simulations, and no single 'best' model exists. The selection of climate scenarios for impacts assessments should not be undertaken arbitrarily - strengths and weakness of different climate models should be considered. In this paper, we provide bioclimatic modellers with an overview of emissions scenarios and climate models, discuss uncertainty surrounding projections of future climate and suggest steps that can be taken to reduce and communicate climate scenario-related uncertainty in assessments of future species responses to climate change.},

Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people.

Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes recent research in Australia on: (i) climate and geophysical trends over the last few decades; (ii) projections for climate change in the 21st century; (iii) predicted impacts from modelling studies on particular ecosystems and native species; and (iv) ecological effects that have apparently occurred as a response to recent warming. Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed similar to0.8degreesC over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0degreesC by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0degreesC by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Nino Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as bioclim consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0degreesC of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.},

	abstract = {In the face of environmental change, species can evolve new physiological tolerances to cope with altered climatic conditions or move spatially to maintain existing physiological associations with particular climates that define each species' climatic niche. When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6\%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3\%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.},

However, most work so far has focused on the level of the individual. To encourage further use of DEB theory in a population context, we developed DEB-IBM, a generic individual-based model (IBM) that is based on DEB theory. 2. The generic IBM is implemented as a computer program using NetLogo, a free software platformthat is accessible to biologists with little programming background. The IBMuses DEB to represent assimilation, maintenance, growth and reproduction of individuals. The model description follows the overview, design and details ( ODD) protocol, a generic format for describing IBMs, and thereby provides a novel and accessible introduction to DEB theory and how it works in a population context. 3. Dynamic Energy Budget- individual- based model can be used to explore properties of both individual life- history traits and population dynamics, which emerge from the set of DEB parameters of a species, and their interaction with environmental variables such as food density. Furthermore, DEB- IBM can be adapted to address specific research questions, for example by including spatial effects. A user manual explains how this can be done. 4. Dynamic Energy Budget- individual- based model is designed to both facilitate use and testing DEB theory in a population context and to advance individual- based modelling by basing the representation of individuals on well- tested physiological principles.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus causes sporadic but typically fatal infection in horses and humans in eastern Australia. Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging 'footprint' of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level. Further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors.},

	abstract = {Bats are the natural reservoirs of a number of high-impact viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.},

The virus caused an outbreak of severe febrile encephalitis in humans with a high mortality rate, whereas, in pigs, encephalitis and respiratory diseases but with a relatively low mortality rate. The outbreak subsequently spread to various regions of the country and Singapore in the south due to the movement of infected pigs. Nipah virus caused systemic infections in humans, pigs and other mammals. Histopathological and radiological findings were characteristic of the disease. Fruitbats of Pteropid species were identified as the natural reservoir hosts. Evidence suggested that climatic and anthropogenic driven ecological changes coupled with the location of piggeries in orchard and the design of pigsties allowed the spill-over of this novel paramyxovirus from its reservoir host into the domestic pigs and ultimately to humans and other animals.},

Many studies predict that impacts will consist largely of shifts in latitudinal and altitudinal distributions. However, we demonstrate that the impacts of global climate change in the tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia have the potential to result in many extinctions. We develop bioclimatic models of spatial distribution for the regionally endemic rainforest vertebrates and use these models to predict the effects of climate warming on species distributions. Increasing temperature is predicted to result in significant reduction or complete loss of the core environment of all regionally endemic vertebrates. Extinction rates caused by the complete loss of core environments are likely to be severe, nonlinear, with losses increasing rapidly beyond an increase of 2 degrees C, and compounded by other climate-related impacts. Mountain ecosystems around the world, such as the Australian Wet Tropics bioregion, are very diverse, often with high levels of restricted endemism, and are therefore important areas of biodiversity. The results presented here suggest that these systems are severely threatened by climate change.},

The mean direction of the vectors between these pairs was almost perfectly aligned with the indirect gradient represented by the first axis of Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling. It confirms anecdotal evidence of a trend from infrequently grazed roadsides to constantly grazed paddocks. The increasing abundance of annual herbs and grasses along this putative gradient is consistent with documented trends from elsewhere in the world. The response patterns of individual species along the disturbance gradient is consistent with ecological theory predicting unimodal peaks in abundance along physical environmental gradients. The ancestral perennial dominants of the grasslands, Dichanthium sericeum and D. queenslandicum, exhibited a declining response to grazing disturbance. Even the generally unpalatable perennial grass Aristida leptopoda declined considerably in the upper segments of the grazing disturbance gradient. A suite of herbaceous trailing legumes had peaks in their abundance near the middle of the grazing disturbance gradient, trends that can be readily explained by the combination of their palatability and intolerance to competition from tall perennial grasses.

Some observations about seasonality are difficult to reconcile with these explanations. These include the simultaneous appearance of outbreaks across widespread geographic regions of the same latitude; the detection of pathogens in the off-season without epidemic spread; and the consistency of seasonal changes, despite wide variations in weather and human behavior. In contrast, an increase in susceptibility of the host population, perhaps linked to the annual light/dark cycle and mediated by the pattern of melatonin secretion, might account for many heretofore unexplained features of infectious disease seasonality. Ample evidence indicates that photoperiod-driven physiologic changes are typical in mammalian species, including some in humans. If such physiologic changes underlie human resistance to infectious diseases for large portions of the year and the changes can be identified and modified, the therapeutic and preventive implications may be considerable.},

All were adult bats: 6 males (1 Pteronotus parnellii, 2 Natalus stramineus, 2 Artibeus hirsutus, and 1 Leptonycteris nivalis) and 11 females (1 Myotis californicus, 1 Mormoops megalophylla, 8 A. hirsutus, and 1 L. nivalis). High rates of bat infection with H. capsulatum were found in the monitored sites of the State of Morelos. Histoplasma infection of N. stramineus, A. hirsutus, and L. nivalis should be considered as the first records in the world. The fungus isolated from infected bats was identified by its typical mycelial-phase morphology and by its yeast-phase conversion. Exoantigen production confirmed the fungal identification by the presence of specific precipitation lines in double immunodiffusion assays using human immune serum. Histopathologic studies showed intracellular yeast-like cells compatible with H. capsulatum yeast-phase in tissues of several bats, especially in pulmonary (intra-alveolar and septal) macrophages, with none or minimal tissue reaction. In contrast to past reports, present data support a high risk of bat infection with H. capsulatum in Mexican cave environments.},

	abstract = {Anti-parasite behaviour can reduce parasitic infections, but little is known about how such behaviours affect infection location within the host's body and whether parasite distribution ultimately affects tolerance of infection. To assess these questions, we exposed both anaesthetized (no behaviour) and non-anaesthetized Hyla femoralis tadpoles to plagiorchiid cercariae (larval trematodes), and quantified resistance, tolerance (relationship between mass change and infection intensity) and encystment location. Non-anaesthetized tadpoles had significantly more infections in their tail region than anaesthetized tadpoles, which had the majority of their infections in the head. This pattern indicates that parasites preferred to infect the head, but that hosts shunted infections to the tail when possible. Furthermore, there was a significant effect of encystment location on tolerance, with head-infected tadpoles having poorer tolerance to infection than tail-infected tadpoles. Variance partitioning suggests that, among infected tadpoles, behaviour contributed more to tolerance than resistance. These results suggest that, in addition to using behaviour to resist parasites, H. femoralis tadpoles also use behaviour to enhance infection tolerance by deflecting infections posteriorly, away from their vital sensory organs. These findings highlight the need to assess how widespread and important behaviour is to the tolerance of infections.},

The mode of flying-fox to horse transmission remains unclear, but oro-nasal contact with flying-fox urine, faeces or saliva is the most plausible. We used GPS data logger technology to explore the landscape utilisation of black flying-foxes and horses to gain new insight into equine exposure risk. Flying-fox foraging was repetitious, with individuals returning night after night to the same location. There was a preference for fragmented arboreal landscape and non-native plant species, resulting in increased flying-fox activity around rural infrastructure. Our preliminary equine data logger study identified significant variation between diurnal and nocturnal grazing behaviour that, combined with the observed flying-fox foraging behaviour, could contribute to Hendra virus exposure risk. While we found no significant risk-exposing difference in individual horse movement behaviour in this study, the prospect warrants further investigation, as does the broader role of animal behaviour and landscape utilisation on the transmission dynamics of Hendra virus.},

	abstract = {The amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, has been implicated in mass mortalities, population declines and extinctions of amphibians around the world. In almost all cases, amphibian species that have disappeared or declined due to chytridiomycosis coexist with non-declining species. One reason why some species decline from chytridiomycosis and others do not may be interspecific differences in behaviour. Host behaviour could either facilitate or hinder pathogen transmission, and transmission rates in the field are likely to vary among species according the frequency of factors such as physical contact between frogs, contact with infected water and contact with environmental substrates containing B. dendrobatidis. We tracked 117 frogs (28 Litoria nannotis, 27 L. genimaculata and 62 L. lesueuri) at 5 sites where B. dendrobatidis is endemic in the rainforest of tropical northern Queensland and recorded the frequency of frog-to-frog contact and the frequency of contact with stream water and environmental substrates. Frequency of contact with other frogs and with water were highest in L. nannotis, intermediate in L. genimaculata and lowest in L. lesueueri. Environmental substrate use also differed among species. These species-specific opportunities for disease transmission were correlated with conservation status: L. nannotis is the species most susceptible to chytridiomycosis-related declines and L. lesueuri is the least susceptible. Interspecific variation in transmission probability may, therefore, play a large role in determining why chytridiomycosis drives some populations to extinction and not others.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Bangladesh, 4 outbreaks of Nipah virus infection were identified during the period 2001-2004. METHODS: We characterized the clinical features of Nipah virus-infected individuals affected by these outbreaks. We classified patients as having confirmed cases of Nipah virus infection if they had antibodies reactive with Nipah virus antigen. Patients were considered to have probable cases of Nipah virus infection if they had symptoms consistent with Nipah virus infection during the same time and in the same community as patients with confirmed cases. RESULTS: We identified 92 patients with Nipah virus infection, 67 (73\%) of whom died. Although all age groups were affected, 2 outbreaks principally affected young persons (median age, 12 years); 62\% of the affected persons were male. Fever, altered mental status, headache, cough, respiratory difficulty, vomiting, and convulsions were the most common signs and symptoms; clinical and radiographic features of acute respiratory distress syndrome of Nipah illness were identified during the fourth outbreak. Among those who died, death occurred a median of 6 days (range, 2-36 days) after the onset of illness. Patients who died were more likely than survivors to have a temperature {\textbackslash}textgreater37.8 degrees C, altered mental status, difficulty breathing, and abnormal plantar reflexes. Among patients with Nipah virus infection who had well-defined exposure to another patient infected with Nipah virus, the median incubation period was 9 days (range, 6-11 days). CONCLUSIONS: Nipah virus infection produced rapidly progressive severe illness affecting the central nervous and respiratory systems. Clinical characteristics of Nipah virus infection in Bangladesh, including a severe respiratory component, appear distinct from clinical characteristics reported during earlier outbreaks in other countries.},

Since then it has occurred regularly within a portion of the geographical distribution of all Australian flying fox (fruit bat) species. There is, however, little understanding about which species are most likely responsible for spillover, or why spillover does not occur in other areas occupied by reservoir and spillover hosts. Using ecological niche models of the four flying fox species we were able to identify which species are most likely linked to spillover events using the concept of distance to the niche centroid of each species. With this novel approach we found that 20 out of 27 events occur disproportionately closer to the niche centroid of two species (Pteropus alecto and P. conspicillatus). With linear regressions we found a negative relationship between distance to the niche centroid and abundance of these two species. Thus, we suggest that the bioclimatic niche of these two species is likely driving the spatial pattern of spillover of Hendra virus into horses and ultimately humans.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of acute respiratory disease occurred in several cattle herds in the south-east regions of Norway during the winter and spring of 1995. The present study was conducted to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the occurrence of acute respiratory disease between January and April 1995 in the affected cattle herds, in two neighbouring counties in Norway. This was done to assess the possible role of an infectious agent in these outbreaks, as well as to investigate the possibility of transmission between neighbouring herds. During the study period, a total of 190 (19.8\{\%\}) outbreaks occurred in 955 cattle herds located in the defined study area. Descriptive maps of the spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of the outbreak were generated, and two different statistical tests of space-time interaction (the Knox test and k-nearest neighbour test) and a cluster-detection test (the space-time scan statistic) were used. The results of all the space-time interaction tests strongly suggested that the case herds were clustered in time as well as in space. In addition, the space-time scan statistic defined the most-likely cluster to be located within the second veterinary district (Toten where the disease occurred) during 9-15 weeks in 1995. The relative risk of a herd being infected inside the most-likely cluster compared with the surrounding study area was estimated to be 3.59 (p=0.001). The transmission rate between neighbouring farms therefore appeared to have been higher within this cluster than in the surrounding study area. This study supports the hypothesis that one common source of infection was involved in the outbreaks during the study period.},

In both these treatment periods nine (three cold blood and six warm blood) adult horses were exposed to all the three paddock size treatments for 2 h daily, for 1 week in each paddock size, and the order of paddock size treatments were rotated systematically. In between turnout in paddocks the horses were all housed in tie stalls. In the non-exercise period the horses walked significantly more, they travelled a longer distance, explored more and stood more alert, than in the period with exercise. The horses stood less passively in the large paddock compared to the medium and the small paddock, and they also travelled a longer distance in the larger paddock sizes. At days with heavy rain and wind, the horses were more restless and walked significantly more than in warmer weather. In conclusion; daily exercise significantly reduced the general activity in the paddocks. Increasing the paddock size to 450 m2, increased the time spent eating grass from under the fence and decreased the time spent standing passively. \{©\} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) causes highly lethal disease in horses and humans in the eastern Australian states of Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW), with multiple equine cases now reported on an annual basis. Infection and excretion dynamics in pteropid bats (flying-foxes), the recognised natural reservoir, are incompletely understood. We sought to identify key spatial and temporal factors associated with excretion in flying-foxes over a 2300 km latitudinal gradient from northern QLD to southern NSW which encompassed all known equine case locations. The aim was to strengthen knowledge of Hendra virus ecology in flying-foxes to improve spillover risk prediction and exposure risk mitigation strategies, and thus better protect horses and humans. Monthly pooled urine samples were collected from under roosting flying-foxes over a three-year period and screened for HeV RNA by quantitative RT-PCR. A generalised linear model was employed to investigate spatiotemporal associations with HeV detection in 13,968 samples from 27 roosts. There was a non-linear relationship between mean HeV excretion prevalence and five latitudinal regions, with excretion moderate in northern and central QLD, highest in southern QLD/northern NSW, moderate in central NSW, and negligible in southern NSW. Highest HeV positivity occurred where black or spectacled flying-foxes were present; nil or very low positivity rates occurred in exclusive grey-headed flying-fox roosts. Similarly, little red flying-foxes are evidently not a significant source of virus, as their periodic extreme increase in numbers at some roosts was not associated with any concurrent increase in HeV detection. There was a consistent, strong winter seasonality to excretion in the southern QLD/northern NSW and central NSW regions. This new information allows risk management strategies to be refined and targeted, mindful of the potential for spatial risk profiles to shift over time with changes in flying-fox species distribution.},

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46\% since the start of human civilization.},

Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options. CONCLUSION: This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.},

Seasonal birth pulses are frequently observed in wildlife and are expected to impact infection dynamics, yet their effect on pathogen persistence and CCS have not been considered. To investigate this issue theoretically, we use stochastic epidemiological models to ask how host life-history traits and infection parameters interact to determine pathogen persistence within a closed popu- lation. We fit seasonal birth pulse models to data from diverse mammalian species in order to identify realistic parameter ranges. When varying the syn- chrony of the birth pulse with all other parameters being constant, our model predicted that the CCS can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Tighter birth pulses tended to drive pathogen extinction by creating large amplitude oscillations in prevalence, especially with high demographic turn- over and short infectious periods. Parameters affecting the relative timing of the epidemic and birth pulse peaks determined the intensity and direction of the effect of pre-existing immunity in the population on the pathogen's ability},

Expanding migratory patterns observed among bats and the mutation of the virus to seek and successfully infect new hosts is a significant departure from the generalized epidemiological trend.

Traditional models for controlling the spread of the vector are futile given the rapid pace at which bats' habitats are eroded. Recent ongoing zoonotic epidemics, for example, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, demonstrate that human-to-human transmission is a distinct reality rather than an obscure possibility.

This requires ensembles of multi-decadal simulations to assess both chaotic climate variability and model response uncertainty. Statistical estimates of model response uncertainty, based on observations of recent climate change, admit climate sensitivities–defined as the equilibrium response of global mean temperature to doubling levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide–substantially greater than 5 K. But such strong responses are not used in ranges for future climate change because they have not been seen in general circulation models. Here we present results from the 'climateprediction.net' experiment, the first multi-thousand-member grand ensemble of simulations using a general circulation model and thereby explicitly resolving regional details. We find model versions as realistic as other state-of-the-art climate models but with climate sensitivities ranging from less than 2 K to more than 11 K. Models with such extreme sensitivities are critical for the study of the full range of possible responses of the climate system to rising greenhouse gas levels, and for assessing the risks associated with specific targets for stabilizing these levels.},

Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.},

Four influenza A virus isolates (A/WI/4754/94, A/WI/4756/94, A/WI/4758/94, A/WI/4760/94) were recovered from a 39-year-old man and 2 (A/WI/4755/94, A/WI/4757/94) from a 31-year-old woman. The HAs of the isolates were antigenically indistinguishable from the virus used to infect the pigs. Sequence analysis of the HA genes indicated they were 99.7\% identical to the HA of the virus used in the experiment. Multisegment reverse transcription-PCR proved that all of the segments originated from Sw/IN, demonstrating that transmission of swine H1N1 viruses to humans occurs directly and readily, despite Animal Biosafety Level 3 containment practices used for these experiments.},

Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20\% to 80\% and 5 degrees C, 20 degrees C, or 30 degrees C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission. The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 degrees C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80\%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle. For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 degrees C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 degrees C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 degrees C. To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined. Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 degrees C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system. Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear. We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.},

	abstract = {The introduction of swine or avian influenza (AI) viruses in the human population can set the stage for a pandemic, and many fear that the Asian H5N1 AI virus will become the next pandemic virus. This article first compares the pathogenesis of avian, swine and human influenza viruses in their natural hosts. The major aim was to evaluate the zoonotic potential of swine and avian viruses, and the possible role of pigs in the transmission of AI viruses to humans. Cross-species transfers of swine and avian influenza to humans have been documented on several occasions, but all these viruses lacked the critical capacity to spread from human-to-human. The extreme virulence of H5N1 in humans has been associated with excessive virus replication in the lungs and a prolonged overproduction of cytokines by the host, but there remain many questions about the exact viral cell and tissue tropism. Though pigs are susceptible to several AI subtypes, including H5N1, there is clearly a serious barrier to infection of pigs with such viruses. AI viruses frequently undergo reassortment in pigs, but there is no proof for a role of pigs in the generation of the 1957 or 1968 pandemic reassortants, or in the transmission of H5N1 or other wholly avian viruses to humans. The major conclusion is that cross-species transmission of influenza viruses per se is insufficient to start a human influenza pandemic and that animal influenza viruses must undergo dramatic but largely unknown genetic changes to become established in the human population.},

The aquatic bird viruses do not replicate well in humans, and these viruses need to reassort or adapt in an intermediate host before they emerge in human populations. Pigs can serve as a host for avian and human viruses and are logical candidates for the role of intermediate host. The transmission of avian H5N1 and H9N2 viruses directly to humans during the late 1990s showed that land-based poultry also can serve between aquatic birds and humans as intermediate hosts of influenza viruses. That these transmission events took place in Hong Kong and China adds further support to the hypothesis that Asia is an epicentre for influenza and stresses the importance of surveillance of pigs and live-bird markets in this area.},

Although most experts believe we will face another influenza pandemic, it is impossible to predict when it will appear, where it will originate, or how severe it will be. Nor is there agreement about the subtype of influenza virus most likely to cause the next pandemic.

	abstract = {Wild birds in the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the natural reservoir for avian influenza (AI) viruses. Transmission within these aquatic bird populations occurs through an indirect fecal-oral route involving contaminated water on shared aquatic habitats. In order to better understand the influence that aquatic environments exert on AI transmission and maintenance in the wild-bird reservoir system, we determined the duration of persistence for 12 wild-bird origin AI viruses under natural ranges of pH, salinity, and temperature. Viral persistence was measured using a laboratory-based distilled water model system. The AI viruses varied in their response to each of the examined variables, but, generally, the viruses were most stable at a slightly basic pH (7.4-8.2), low temperatures ({\textbackslash}textless17 ??C), and fresh to brackish salinities (0-20,000 parts per million (ppm)). Alternatively, the AI viruses had a much shorter duration of persistence in acidic conditions (pH {\textbackslash}textless 6.6), warmer temperatures ({\textbackslash}textgreater32 ??C), and high salinity ({\textbackslash}textgreater25,000 ppm). The results of this research suggest that the pH, temperature, and salinity in natural aquatic habitats can influence the ability of AI viruses to remain infective within these environments. Furthermore, these results provide insight into chemical and physical properties of water that could enhance or restrict AI virus transmission on an aquatic bird habitat. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This type of transmission depends on the ability of the pathogens to survive in the environment. In this report, we describe the survivability of two avian respiratory viruses, e.g., avian metapneumovirus and avian influenza virus on 12 different porous and nonporous surfaces. The viruses survived on some of the surfaces for up to 6 days postcontamination but not after 9 days. Both viruses survived longer on nonporous surfaces than on porous ones. One of the reasons for poor survival on porous surfaces could be inefficient elution of virus from these surfaces. These results should be helpful in determining how long the premises should be left vacant after an outbreak of these viruses has occurred in poultry houses.},

The structure of the virus is directly dependent on the genetic makeup of the viral genome except the glycosylation moieties and the composition of the lipid bilayer. They both depend on the host cell and are in direct contact with the environment, such as air or water. Virus survival is important for virus transmission from contaminated waters in the case of wild aquatic birds or from contaminated surface or air for humans.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to check whether the origin species of the host cell has an influence on influenza A virus survival.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nMETHOD: The persistence in water at 35°C of viruses grown on either mammalian cells or avian cells and belonging to two different subtypes H1N1 and H5N1 was compared.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\$nRESULTS: Both H5N1 and H1N1 viruses remained infectious for periods of time as long as 19-25 days, respectively.

Influenza virus activity displays strong seasonal cycles in temperate areas of the world and less defined seasonality in tropical regions (5), suggesting that environmental factors may drive seasonal patterns. In a recent issue of PNAS, Shaman and Kohn (6) move us a step closer to understanding influenza seasonality by clarifying the impact of environmental factors on influenza virus transmission and survival.

	abstract = {Wild birds are important to public health because they carry emerging zoonotic pathogens, either as a reservoir host or by dispersing infected arthropod vectors. In addition, bird migration provides a mechanism for the establishment of new endemic foci of disease at great distances from where an infection was acquired. Birds are central to the epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV) because they are the main amplifying host of the virus in nature. The initial spread of WNV in the U.S. along the eastern seaboard coincided with a major bird migration corridor. The subsequent rapid movement of the virus inland could have been facilitated by the elliptical migration routes used by many songbirds. A number of bird species can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, but most are not competent to transmit the infection to Ixodes ticks. The major role birds play in the geographic expansion of Lyme disease is as dispersers of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Aquatic waterfowl are asymptomatic carriers of essentially all hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations of influenza A virus. Avian influenza strains do not usually replicate well in humans, but they can undergo genetic reassortment with human strains that co-infect pigs. This can result in new strains with a marked increase in virulence for humans. Wild birds can acquire enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter spp., by feeding on raw sewage and garbage, and can spread these agents to humans directly or by contaminating commercial poultry operations. Conversely, wild birds can acquire drug-resistant enteropathogens from farms and spread these strains along migration routes. Birds contribute to the global spread of emerging infectious diseases in a manner analogous to humans traveling on aircraft. A better understanding of avian migration patterns and infectious diseases of birds would be useful in helping to predict future outbreaks of infections due to emerging zoonotic pathogens.},

Between the end of February and the end of May 2003, a fowl plague outbreak occurred in The Netherlands. A highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H7N7, closely related to low pathogenic virus isolates obtained from wild ducks, was isolated from chickens. The same virus was detected subsequently in 86 humans who handled affected poultry and in three of their family members. Of these 89 patients, 78 presented with conjunctivitis, 5 presented with conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness, 2 presented with influenza-like illness, and 4 did not fit the case definitions. Influenza-like illnesses were generally mild, but a fatal case of pneumonia in combination with acute respiratory distress syndrome occurred also. Most virus isolates obtained from humans, including probable secondary cases, had not accumulated significant mutations. However, the virus isolated from the fatal case displayed 14 amino acid substitutions, some of which may be associated with enhanced disease in this case. Because H7N7 viruses have caused disease in mammals, including horses, seals, and humans, on several occasions in the past, they may be unusual in their zoonotic potential and, thus, form a pandemic threat to humans.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The relative importance of airborne, droplet and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends among other factors on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Methods: We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes. Results: Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1-102, on hands in the order of 103. Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. Conclusions: The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. ?? 2008 The British Infection Society.},

As it is dependent on virus isolates even within the same subtype, we studied the survival of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) virus in water and on non-porous surface. The H1N1pdm virus was subjected to various environmental parameters over time and tested for infectivity. In water, at low and medium salinity levels and 4°C, virus survived at least 200 days. Increasing temperature and salinity had a strong negative effect on the survival of the virus which remained infectious no more than 1 day at 35°C and 270 parts per thousand (ppt) of salt. Based on modeled data, the H1N1pdm virus retained its infectivity on smooth non-porous surface for at least 7 days at 35°C and up to 66 days at 4°C. The H1N1pdm virus has thus the ability to persist in water and on glass surface for extended periods of time, even at 35°C. Additional experiments suggest that external viral structures in direct contact with the environment are mostly involved in loss of virus infectivity.},

For example, Hendra virus (HeV), a zoonotic paramyxovirus, was discovered in 1994, and since then, infections have occurred in 7 humans, each of whom had a strong epidemiologic link to similarly affected horses. As a consequence of these outbreaks, eradication of bat populations was discussed, despite their crucial environmental roles in pollination and reduction of the insect population. We describe the development and evaluation of a vaccine for horses with the potential for breaking the chain of HeV transmission from bats to horses to humans, thereby protecting horse, human, and environmental health. The HeV vaccine for horses is a key example of a One Health approach to the control of human disease.},

Previous research has shown that higher temperatures led to lower virus survival rates in the laboratory. We develop a model of survival of HeV in the environment as influenced by temperature. We used 20 years of daily temperature at six locations spanning the geographic range of reported HeV incidents to simulate the temporal and spatial impacts of temperature on HeV survival. At any location, simulated virus survival was greater in winter than in summer, and in any month of the year, survival was higher in higher latitudes. At any location, year-to-year variation in virus survival 24 h post-excretion was substantial and was as large as the difference between locations. Survival was higher in microhabitats with lower than ambient temperature, and when environmental exposure was shorter. The within-year pattern of virus survival mirrored the cumulative within-year occurrence of reported HeV cases, although there were no overall differences in survival in HeV case years and non-case years. The model examines the effect of temperature in isolation; actual virus survivability will reflect the effect of additional environmental factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model is presented that explores the relationship between transmission patterns and the evolution of virulence for horizontally transmitted parasites when only a single parasite strain can infect each host. The model is constructed by decomposing parasite transmission into two processes, the rate of contact between hosts and the probability of transmission per contact. These transmission rate components, as well as the total parasite mortality rate, are allowed to vary over the course of an infection. A general evolutionarily stable condition is presented that partitions the effects of virulence on parasite fitness into three components: fecundity benefits, mortality costs, and morbidity costs. This extension of previous theory allows us to explore the evolutionary consequences of a variety of transmission patterns. I then focus attention on a special case in which the parasite density remains approximately constant during an infection, and I demonstrate two important ways in which transmission modes can affect virulence evolution: by imposing different morbidity costs on the parasite and by altering the scheduling of parasite reproduction during an infection. Both are illustrated with examples, including one that examines the hypothesis that vector-borne parasites should be more virulent than non-vector-borne parasites (Ewald 1994). The validity of this hypothesis depends upon the way in which these two effects interact, and it need not hold in general.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus causes sporadic but typically fatal infection in horses and humans in eastern Australia. Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging 'footprint' of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level. Further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors.},

	abstract = {In the face of environmental change, species can evolve new physiological tolerances to cope with altered climatic conditions or move spatially to maintain existing physiological associations with particular climates that define each species' climatic niche. When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6\%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3\%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.},

We tested the toxicity of northwestern ring-necked snake oral secretions to a natural prey species, northwestern garter snakes (Thamnophis ordinoides), by injecting 2-35 microl of oral secretions intraperitoneally. All doses were 100\% lethal within 180 min. The dose significantly affected the time to loss of a righting response. Neither injection of saline nor denatured oral secretions resulted in loss of a righting response or any visible detrimental effects. We suggest that northwestern ring-necked snakes may have evolved venom to subdue larger prey items than the snake would otherwise be capable of taking.},

This opens promising perspectives for understanding how an animal perceives and reacts to the multi-scale structure of its environment. Yet, conceptual issues such as confusion between movement scales and searching modes prevent us from properly inferring the movement processes at different scales. Here, I propose to build on stationarity (i.e. stability of statistical parameters) to develop a consistent theoretical framework in which animal movements are modelled as a generic composite multi-scale multi-mode random walk model. This framework makes it possible to highlight scales that are relevant to the studied animal, the nature of the behavioural processes that operate at each of these different scales, and the way in which the processes involved at any given scale can interact with those operating at smaller or larger scales. This explicitly scale-focused approach should help properly analyse actual movements by relating, for each scale and each mode, the values of the main model parameters (speed, short- and long-term persistences, degree of stochasticity) to the animal's needs and skills and its response to its environment at multiple scales.},

	abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

	abstract = {Marburg virus (family Filoviridae) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Bats have been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in 2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40,000 R. aegyptiacus were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present. Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1,622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated ∼2.5\% of the bats were actively infected, seven of which yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for R. aegyptiacus tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (∼six months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83\% (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of two tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with R. aegyptiacus bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges. These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg hemorrhagic fever risk reduction strategies.},

Clinical signs in human cases indicated primarily involvement of the central nervous system, while in pigs the respiratory system was considered the primary virus target, with only rare involvement of the central nervous system. Eleven 5-week-old piglets were infected intranasally, orally, and ocularly with 2.5 x 10(5) PFU of Nipah virus per animal and euthanized between 3 and 8 days postinoculation. Nipah virus caused neurological signs in two out of eleven inoculated pigs. The rest of the pigs remained clinically healthy. Virus was detected in the respiratory system (turbinates, nasopharynx, trachea, bronchus, and lung in titers up to 10(5.3) PFU/g) and in the lymphoreticular system (endothelial cells of blood and lymphatic vessels, submandibular and bronchiolar lymph nodes, tonsil, and spleen with titers up to 10(6) PFU/g). Virus presence was confirmed in the nervous system of both sick and apparently healthy animals (cranial nerves, trigeminal ganglion, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid, with titers up to 10(7.7) PFU/g of tissue). Nipah virus distribution was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The study presents novel findings indicating that Nipah virus invaded the central nervous system of the porcine host via cranial nerves as well as by crossing the blood-brain barrier after initial virus replication in the upper respiratory tract.},

However, little is known about the roles of bat species in the ecology and geographic distribution of the virus. This contribution aims to address a series of questions regarding the ecology of rabies transmission in Chile. Analyzing records from 1985-2011 at the Instituto de Salud Pública de Chile (ISP) and using ecological niche modeling, we address these questions to help in understanding rabies-bat ecological dynamics in South America. We found ecological niche identity between both hosts and both viral variants, indicating that niches of all actors in the system are undifferentiated, although the viruses do not necessarily occupy the full geographic distributions of their hosts. Bat species and rabies viruses share similar niches, and our models had significant predictive power even across unsampled regions; results thus suggest that outbreaks may occur under consistent, stable, and predictable circumstances.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Every year West African countries within the Sahelo-Sudanian band are afflicted with major meningococcal meningitis (MCM) disease outbreaks, which affect up to 200,000 people, mainly young children, in one of the world's poorest regions. The timing of the epidemic year, which starts in February and ends in late May, and the spatial distribution of disease cases throughout the "Meningitis Belt" strongly indicate a close linkage between the life cycle of the causative agent of MCM and climate variability. However, mechanisms responsible for the observed patterns are still not clearly identified. METHODS AND FINDINGS: By comparing the information on cases and deaths of MCM from World Health Organization weekly reports with atmospheric datasets, we quantified the relationship between the seasonal occurrence of MCM in Mali, a West African country, and large-scale atmospheric circulation. Regional atmospheric indexes based on surface wind speed show a clear link between population dynamics of the disease and climate: the onset of epidemics and the winter maximum defined by the atmospheric index share the same mean week (sixth week of the year; standard deviation, 2 wk) and are highly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first that provides a clear, quantitative demonstration of the connections that exist between MCM epidemics and regional climate variability in Africa. Moreover, this statistically robust explanation of the MCM dynamics enables the development of an Early Warning Index for meningitis epidemic onset in West Africa. The development of such an index will undoubtedly help nationwide and international public health institutions and policy makers to better control MCM disease within the so-called westward-eastward pan-African Meningitis Belt.},

However, the mechanisms responsible for seasonal disease incidence, and the epidemiological consequences of seasonality, are poorly understood with rare exception. Standard epidemiological theory and concepts such as the basic reproductive number R0 no longer apply, and the implications for interventions that themselves may be periodic, such as pulse vaccination, have not been formally examined. This paper examines the causes and consequences of seasonality, and in so doing derives several new results concerning vaccination strategy and the interpretation of disease outbreak data. It begins with a brief review of published scientific studies in support of different causes of seasonality in infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R0, disease outbreaks, endemic dynamics and persistence. Finally, a mathematical analysis of routine and pulse vaccination programmes for seasonal infections is presented. The synthesis of seasonal infectious disease epidemiology attempted by this paper highlights the need for further empirical and theoretical work.},

	abstract = {Flying-foxes (Pteropodidae) are large bats capable of long-distance flight. Many species are threatened; some are considered pests. Effective conservation and management of flying-foxes are constrained by lack of knowledge of their ecology, especially of movement patterns over large spatial scales. Using satellite telemetry, we quantified long-distance movements of the grey-headed flying-fox Pteropus poliocephalus among roost sites in eastern Australia. Fourteen adult males were tracked for 2-40 weeks (mean 25 weeks). Collectively, these individuals utilised 77 roost sites in an area spanning 1,075 km by 128 km. Movement patterns varied greatly between individuals, with some travelling long distances. Five individuals travelled cumulative distances {\textbackslash}textgreater1,000 km over the study period. Five individuals showed net displacements {\textbackslash}textgreater300 km during one month, including one movement of 500 km within 48 hours. Seasonal movements were consistent with facultative latitudinal migration in part of the population. Flying-foxes shifted roost sites frequently: 64\% of roost visits lasted {\textbackslash}textless5 consecutive days, although some individuals remained at one roost for several months. Modal 2-day distances between consecutive roosts were 21-50 km (mean 45 km, range 3-166 km). Of 13 individuals tracked for {\textbackslash}textgreater12 weeks, 10 moved {\textbackslash}textgreater100 km in one or more weeks. Median cumulative displacement distances over 1, 10 and 30 weeks were 0 km, 260 km and 821 km, respectively. On average, over increasing time-periods, one additional roost site was visited for each additional 100 km travelled. These findings explain why culling and relocation attempts have had limited success in resolving human-bat conflicts in Australia. Flying-foxes are highly mobile between camps and regularly travel long distances. Consequently, local control actions are likely to have only temporary effects on local flying-fox populations. Developing alternative methods to manage these conflicts remains an important challenge that should be informed by a better understanding of the species' movement patterns.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus, first identified in 1994 in Queensland, is an emerging zoonotic pathogen gaining importance in Australia because a growing number of infections are reported in horses and people. The virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae (genus Henipavirus), is transmitted to horses by pteropid bats (fruit bats or flying foxes), with human infection a result of direct contact with infected horses. Case-fatality rate is high in both horses and people, and so far, more than 60 horses and four people have died from Hendra virus infection in Australia. Human infection is characterised by an acute encephalitic syndrome or relapsing encephalitis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Recent identification of Hendra virus infection in a domestic animal outside the laboratory setting, and the large range of pteropid bats in Australia, underpins the potential of this virus to cause greater morbidity and mortality in both rural and urban populations and its importance to both veterinary and human health. Attempts at treatment with ribavirin and chloroquine have been unsuccessful. Education, hygiene, and infection control measures have hitherto been the mainstay of prevention, while access to monoclonal antibody treatment and development of an animal vaccine offer further opportunities for disease prevention and control. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the effects of temperature extremes on natural systems. This is of increasing concern now that climate models predict dramatic increases in the intensity, duration and frequency of such extremes. Here we examine the effects of temperature extremes on behaviour and demography of vulnerable wild flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.). On 12 January 2002 in New South Wales, Australia, temperatures exceeding 42 degrees C killed over 3500 individuals in nine mixed-species colonies. In one colony, we recorded a predictable sequence of thermoregulatory behaviours (wing-fanning, shade-seeking, panting and saliva-spreading, respectively) and witnessed how 5-6\% of bats died from hyperthermia. Mortality was greater among the tropical black flying-fox, Pteropus alecto (10-13\%) than the temperate grey-headed flying-fox, Pteropus poliocephalus (less than 1\%), and young and adult females were more affected than adult males (young, 23-49\%; females, 10-15\%; males, less than 3\%). Since 1994, over 30000 flying-foxes (including at least 24500 P. poliocephalus) were killed during 19 similar events. Although P. alecto was relatively less affected, it is currently expanding its range into the more variable temperature envelope of P. poliocephalus, which increases the likelihood of die-offs occurring in this species. Temperature extremes are important additional threats to Australian flying-foxes and the ecosystem services they provide, and we recommend close monitoring of colonies where temperatures exceeding 42.0 degrees C are predicted. The effects of temperature extremes on flying-foxes highlight the complex implications of climate change for behaviour, demography and species survival.},

The animals moved independently in time and space among various communal roosts located 8-610 km from the maternity camp sites. Generally, P. poliocephalus from a camp near rainforest (Currie Park, Lismore) remained within 50 km of the maternity site. These localised movements were attributed to the continued availability of fruits in the rainforest throughout the study. Animals from a maternity camp surrounded by sclerophyll forest (Susan I., Grafton) undertook long migrations south (median distance 342.5 km, n = 11) to camps containing up to 200 000 P. poliocephalus of both sexes. These large aggregations formed during the mating season and comprised individuals drawn from various previous sites. Thus, P. poliocephalus in northern and central N.S.W. appear to function as a single breeding population and should be managed as such. After mid-May, animals from Susan I. returned to north-eastern N.S.W. There was high correlation between movements of P. poliocephalus from the camp at Susan I. and the flowering patterns of certain species of Myrtaceae and Proteaceae. It is hypothesised that flowering attractive to apiarists is also attractive to P. poliocephalus and that information from apiarists could be used by wildlife managers to predict large aggregations of the animals.},

Important habitats of P. alecto varied seasonally and included floodplain, mangrove, monsoon rainforest, Melaleuca open-forest, and Eucalyptus miniata/E. tetrodonta open-forest and woodland. The minimum scale at which conservation of P. alecto should be attempted is in the order of 5000 km2, based on seasonal patterns of habitat use. The size of this area will make conservation via traditional reserves difficult and conservation of important habitats outside reserves will be needed. Habitats protected for the benefit of P. alecto will also benefit P. scapulatus but because P. scapulatus is more mobile, displays greater yearly variation in distribution and is less well understood than P. alecto, appropriate conservation actions are less certain.},

	abstract = {Flying-foxes (Pteropodidae) are large bats capable of long-distance flight. Many species are threatened; some are considered pests. Effective conservation and management of flying-foxes are constrained by lack of knowledge of their ecology, especially of movement patterns over large spatial scales. Using satellite telemetry, we quantified long-distance movements of the grey-headed flying-fox Pteropus poliocephalus among roost sites in eastern Australia. Fourteen adult males were tracked for 2-40 weeks (mean 25 weeks). Collectively, these individuals utilised 77 roost sites in an area spanning 1,075 km by 128 km. Movement patterns varied greatly between individuals, with some travelling long distances. Five individuals travelled cumulative distances {\textbackslash}textgreater1,000 km over the study period. Five individuals showed net displacements {\textbackslash}textgreater300 km during one month, including one movement of 500 km within 48 hours. Seasonal movements were consistent with facultative latitudinal migration in part of the population. Flying-foxes shifted roost sites frequently: 64\% of roost visits lasted {\textbackslash}textless5 consecutive days, although some individuals remained at one roost for several months. Modal 2-day distances between consecutive roosts were 21-50 km (mean 45 km, range 3-166 km). Of 13 individuals tracked for {\textbackslash}textgreater12 weeks, 10 moved {\textbackslash}textgreater100 km in one or more weeks. Median cumulative displacement distances over 1, 10 and 30 weeks were 0 km, 260 km and 821 km, respectively. On average, over increasing time-periods, one additional roost site was visited for each additional 100 km travelled. These findings explain why culling and relocation attempts have had limited success in resolving human-bat conflicts in Australia. Flying-foxes are highly mobile between camps and regularly travel long distances. Consequently, local control actions are likely to have only temporary effects on local flying-fox populations. Developing alternative methods to manage these conflicts remains an important challenge that should be informed by a better understanding of the species' movement patterns.},

	abstract = {1. Flying foxes Pteropus spp. play a key role in forest regeneration as seed dispersers and are also the reservoir of many viruses, including Nipah virus in Bangladesh. Little is known about their habitat requirements, particularly in South Asia. Identifying Pteropus habitat preferences could assist in understanding the risk of zoonotic disease transmission broadly, and in Bangladesh, could help explain the spatial distribution of human Nipah virus cases. 2. We analysed characteristics of Pteropus giganteus roosts and constructed an ecological niche model to identify suitable habitat in Bangladesh. We also assessed the distribution of suitable habitat in relation to the location of human Nipah virus cases. 3. Compared to non-roost trees, P. giganteus roost trees are taller with larger diameters, and are more frequently canopy trees. Colony size was larger in densely forested regions and smaller in flood-affected areas. Roosts were located in areas with lower annual precipitation and higher human population density than non-roost sites. 4. We predicted that 2-17\% of Bangladesh's land area is suitable roosting habitat. Nipah virus outbreak villages were 2.6 times more likely to be located in areas predicted as highly suitable habitat for P. giganteus compared to non-outbreak villages. 5. Synthesis and applications. Habitat suitability modelling may help identify previously undocumented Nipah outbreak locations and improve our understanding of Nipah virus ecology by highlighting regions where there is suitable bat habitat but no reported human Nipah virus. Conservation and public health education is a key component of P. giganteus management in Bangladesh due to the general misunderstanding and fear of bats that are a reservoir of Nipah virus. Affiliation between Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) and people is common throughout their range, and in order to conserve these keystone bat species and prevent emergence of zoonotic viruses, it is imperative that we continue to improve our understanding of Pteropus resource requirements and routes of virus transmission from bats to people. Results presented here can be utilized to develop land management strategies and conservation policies that simultaneously protect fruit bats and public health.},

Our preliminary studies revealed a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to HeV in bats of the genus PTEROPUS:, but it was unclear whether this was due to infection with HeV or a related virus. We developed the hypothesis that HeV excretion from bats might be related to the birthing process and we targeted the reproductive tract for virus isolation. Three virus isolates were obtained from the uterine fluid and a pool of foetal lung and liver from one grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), and from the foetal lung of one black flying-fox (P. alecto). Antigenically, these isolates appeared to be closely related to HeV, returning positive results on immunofluorescent antibody staining and constant-serum varying-virus neutralization tests. Using an HeV-specific oligonucleotide primer pair, genomic sequences of the isolates were amplified. Sequencing of 200 nucleotides in the matrix gene identified that these three isolates were identical to HeV. Isolations were confirmed after RNA extracted from original material was positive for HeV RNA when screened on an HeV Taqman assay. The isolation of HeV from pteropid bats corroborates our earlier serological and epidemiological evidence that they are a natural reservoir host of the virus.},

In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35\% to 60\%.

Several conclusions are drawn, among them: a) model and variable forms should be selected based on regression diagnostic procedures, in addition to goodness-of-fit tests; b) variable-selection algorithms in current packaged programs, such as conventional stepwise regression, can easily lead to invalid estimates and tests of effect; and c) variable selection is better approached by direct estimation of the degree of confounding produced by each variable than by significance-testing algorithms.

Using a simple deterministic model for exposure effects, a logical connection is drawn between the concepts of identifiability, exchangeability, and confounding. This connection allows one to view the problem of confounding as arising from problems of identifiability, and reveals the exchangeability assumptions that are implicit in confounder control methods. It also provides further justification for confounder definitions based on comparability of exposure groups, as opposed to collapsibility-based definitions.},

However, the consideration of a priori causal knowledge suggests that the crude odds ratio of 0.65 (95\% confidence interval: 0.46, 0.94) should be used because the adjusted odds ratio is invalid. Causal diagrams are used to encode qualitative a priori subject matter knowledge.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of statistical methods that infer evolutionary and ecological processes from data on species distributions. These methods have led to considerable new insights, but they often fail to account for the effects of historical biogeography on present-day species distributions. Because the geography of speciation can lead to patterns of spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the distributions of species within a clade, this can result in misleading inferences about the importance of deterministic processes in generating spatial patterns of biodiversity. In this opinion article, we discuss ways in which patterns of species distributions driven by historical biogeography are often interpreted as evidence of particular evolutionary or ecological processes. We focus on three areas that are especially prone to such misinterpretations: community phylogenetics, environmental niche modelling, and analyses of beta diversity (compositional turnover of biodiversity).},

Biosecurity restrictions impede advances, particularly on understanding pathways of transmission. Quantifying HeV's environmental survival can be used for making decisions and to infer transmission pathways. We estimated HeV survival with a Weibull distribution and calculated parameters from data generated in laboratory experiments. HeV survival rates based on air temperatures 24 h after excretion ranged from 2 to 10\% in summer and from 12 to 33\% in winter. Simulated survival across the distribution of Pteropus alecto, a key reservoir host, does not predict spillover events. Based on our analyses we conclude that the most likely pathways of transmission do not require long periods of virus survival and are likely to involve relatively direct contact with flying fox excreta shortly after excretion.},

The geographic potential for additional outbreaks is outlined, including in several countries in which the virus is not known.

Recently, horseshoe bats in the genus Rhinolophus have been identified as natural reservoir of SARS-like coronaviruses. Here, we review studies by different groups demonstrating that SARS-CoV succeeded in spillover from a wildlife reservoir (probably bats) to human population via an intermediate host(s) and that rapid virus evolution played a key role in the adaptation of SARS-CoVs in at least two nonreservoir species within a short period.},

These mammals provide us with resources, but their importance is minimized and many of their populations and species are at risk, even threatened or endangered. Some of their characteristics (food choices, colonial or solitary nature, population structure, ability to fly, seasonal migration and daily movement patterns, torpor and hibernation, life span, roosting behaviors, ability to echolocate, virus susceptibility) make them exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents. Bats of certain species are well recognized as being capable of transmitting rabies virus, but recent observations of outbreaks and epidemics of newly recognized human and livestock diseases caused by viruses transmitted by various megachiropteran and microchiropteran bats have drawn attention anew to these remarkable mammals. This paper summarizes information regarding chiropteran characteristics and information regarding 66 viruses that have been isolated from bats. From these summaries, it is clear that we do not know enough about bat biology; we are doing too little in terms of bat conservation; and there remain a multitude of questions regarding the role of bats in disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Animal-borne sensors enable researchers to remotely track animals, their physiological state and body movements. Accelerometers, for example, have been used in several studies to measure body movement, posture, and energy expenditure, although predominantly in marine animals. In many studies, behaviour is often inferred from expert interpretation of sensor data and not validated with direct observations of the animal. The aim of this study was to derive models that could be used to classify oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) behaviour based on sensor data. We measured the location, speed, and tri-axial acceleration of three oystercatchers using a flexible GPS tracking system and conducted simultaneous visual observations of the behaviour of these birds in their natural environment. We then used these data to develop three supervised classification trees of behaviour and finally applied one of the models to calculate time-activity budgets. The model based on accelerometer data developed to classify three behaviours (fly, terrestrial locomotion, and no movement) was much more accurate (cross-validation error = 0.14) than the model based on GPS-speed alone (cross-validation error = 0.35). The most parsimonious acceleration model designed to classify eight behaviours could distinguish five: fly, forage, body care, stand, and sit (cross-validation error = 0.28); other behaviours that were observed, such as aggression or handling of prey, could not be distinguished. Model limitations and potential improvements are discussed. The workflow design presented in this study can facilitate model development, be adapted to a wide range of species, and together with the appropriate measurements, can foster the study of behaviour and habitat use of free living animals throughout their annual routine.},

This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 ground-truthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80-90\%) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750 km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

We took an integrated approach to monitor prey captures by a predator by deploying a video camera (lasting for 85 min) and two accelerometers (on the head and back, lasting for 50 h) on free-swimming Adélie penguins. The movies showed that penguins moved the heads rapidly to capture krill in midwater and fish (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) underneath the sea ice. Captures were remarkably fast (two krill per second in swarms) and efficient (244 krill or 33 P. borchgrevinki in 78-89 min). Prey captures were detected by the signal of head acceleration relative to body acceleration with high sensitivity and specificity (0.83-0.90), as shown by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Extension of signal analysis to the entire behavioral records showed that krill captures were spatially and temporally more variable than P. borchgrevinki captures. Notably, the frequency distribution of krill capture rate closely followed a power-law model, indicating that the foraging success of penguins depends on a small number of very successful dives. The three steps illustrated here (i.e., video observations, linking video to behavioral signals, and extension of signal analysis) are unique approaches to understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecologically important events such as foraging.},

	abstract = {Abstract Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({\textbackslash}textgreater10 Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.

The study found several examples in which agricultural intensification and/or environmental change were associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment. We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.},

Zoonotic disease organisms include those that are endemic in human populations or enzootic in animal populations with frequent cross-species transmission to people. Some of these diseases have only emerged recently. Together, these organisms are responsible for a substantial burden of disease, with endemic and enzootic zoonoses causing about a billion cases of illness in people and millions of deaths every year. Emerging zoonoses are a growing threat to global health and have caused hundreds of billions of US dollars of economic damage in the past 20 years. We aimed to review how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology, and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings. In view of present anthropogenic trends, a more effective approach to zoonotic disease prevention and control will require a broad view of medicine that emphasises evidence-based decision making and integrates ecological and evolutionary principles of animal, human, and environmental factors. This broad view is essential for the successful development of policies and practices that reduce probability of future zoonotic emergence, targeted surveillance and strategic prevention, and engagement of partners outside the medical community to help improve health outcomes and reduce disease threats.},

	abstract = {Modelling the spatial distributions of human parasite species is crucial to understanding the environmental determinants of infection as well as for guiding the planning of control programmes. Here, we use ecological niche modelling to map the current potential distribution of the macroparasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), in Africa, and to estimate how future changes in climate and population could affect its spread and burden across the continent. We used 508 community-specific infection presence data collated from the published literature in conjunction with five predictive environmental/climatic and demographic variables, and a maximum entropy niche modelling method to construct the first ecological niche maps describing potential distribution and burden of LF in Africa. We also ran the best-fit model against climate projections made by the HADCM3 and CCCMA models for 2050 under A2a and B2a scenarios to simulate the likely distribution of LF under future climate and population changes. We predict a broad geographic distribution of LF in Africa extending from the west to the east across the middle region of the continent, with high probabilities of occurrence in the Western Africa compared to large areas of medium probability interspersed with smaller areas of high probability in Central and Eastern Africa and in Madagascar. We uncovered complex relationships between predictor ecological niche variables and the probability of LF occurrence. We show for the first time that predicted climate change and population growth will expand both the range and risk of LF infection (and ultimately disease) in an endemic region. We estimate that populations at risk to LF may range from 543 and 804 million currently, and that this could rise to between 1.65 to 1.86 billion in the future depending on the climate scenario used and thresholds applied to signify infection presence.},

	abstract = {Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels-especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour-is essential for making the science predictive. 'Pattern-oriented modelling' (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.},

However, most work so far has focused on the level of the individual. To encourage further use of DEB theory in a population context, we developed DEB-IBM, a generic individual-based model (IBM) that is based on DEB theory. 2. The generic IBM is implemented as a computer program using NetLogo, a free software platformthat is accessible to biologists with little programming background. The IBMuses DEB to represent assimilation, maintenance, growth and reproduction of individuals. The model description follows the overview, design and details ( ODD) protocol, a generic format for describing IBMs, and thereby provides a novel and accessible introduction to DEB theory and how it works in a population context. 3. Dynamic Energy Budget- individual- based model can be used to explore properties of both individual life- history traits and population dynamics, which emerge from the set of DEB parameters of a species, and their interaction with environmental variables such as food density. Furthermore, DEB- IBM can be adapted to address specific research questions, for example by including spatial effects. A user manual explains how this can be done. 4. Dynamic Energy Budget- individual- based model is designed to both facilitate use and testing DEB theory in a population context and to advance individual- based modelling by basing the representation of individuals on well- tested physiological principles.},

	abstract = {Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) are classified as threatened in Canada, and the Little Smoky herd in west-central Alberta is at immediate risk of extirpation due in part, to anthropogenic activities such as oil, gas, and forestry that have altered the ecosystem dynamics. Winter season represents an especially challenging time of year for this Holarctic species as it is characterized by a shortage of basic resources and is when most industrial development occurs, to which caribou can perceive as increased predation risk. To investigate the impact of industrial features on caribou, we developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioral mechanisms caribou are most likely to employ when navigating their landscape in winter. The ABM model is composed of cognitive caribou agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and predator/disturbance avoidance. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a virtual grid representing the landscape in terms of forage availability, energy content, and predation-risk. The model was calibrated with caribou bio-energetic values from literature sources, and validated using GPS data from thirteen caribou radio-collars deployed over 6 months from 2004 to 2005. Simulations were conducted on alternative caribou habitat-selection strategies by assigning different fitness-maximizing goals to agents. The model outcomes were evaluated using a pattern-oriented modeling approach with actual caribou data. The scenario in which the caribou agent must trade off the mutually competing goals of obtaining its daily energy requirement, conserving reproductive energy, and minimizing predation risk, was found to be the best-fit scenario. Not recognizing industrial features as risk causes simulated caribou to unrealistically reduce their daily and landscape movements; equally, having risk take precedence results in unrealistic energetic deficits and large-scale movement patterns, unlike those observed in actual caribou. These results elucidate the most likely behavioral strategies caribou use to select their winter habitat, the relative extent to which they perceive industry features as potential predation, and the differential energetic costs associated with each strategy. They can assist future studies of how caribou may respond to continued industrial development and/or mitigation measures. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper we describe the application of image classification techniques to high-spatial-resolution digital video imagery (0.8-m pixels) to delimit patches of different marsh vegetation at the refuge. Using maps of vegetation types derived from multispectral imagery, we estimated the area occupied by each vegetation type in potential clapper mil home ranges.

	abstract = {How closely the vegetation of restored wetlands resembles that of comparable natural wetlands is a function of the probability of propagules of wetland species reaching reflooded wetlands and how similar environmental conditions in the restored wetland are those in the natural wetlands. Three years after reflooding, we examined the vegetation composition, water level fluctuations, soil organic carbon content, and soil bulk density as well as surface water pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and calcium and magnesium concentrations of 10 restored and 10 natural wetlands. In the restored wetlands, more species of submersed aquatics colonized than were found in natural wetlands, and they rapidly spread to form extensive beds that were larger than those found in natural wetlands. Emergent and wet meadow species in restored wetlands, however, were found in only sparse stands as were a variety of annuals. The vegetation of natural wetlands was predominantly large stands of emergent species. Fluctuations in water storage volume and basin surface area were similar for both restored and natural wetlands. The surface water in restored wetlands had higher pH and lower alkalinity, conductivity, and calcium and magnesium concentrations than that in natural wetlands. Soils of restored wetlands have a lower organic carbon content and higher bulk density than do those of natural wetlands. Our results suggest that for submersed aquatics, dispersal of propagules to restored wetlands is rapid and environmental conditions in restored wetlands are very suitable for their establishment. For other guilds of wetland species, e.g., sedges and other wet meadow species, dispersal to restored wetlands is likely much slower and may pose a serious problem for the re-establishment of these species in restored wetlands. Even if dispersal is not limiting, low surface organic carbon and high bulk density may prevent the establishment of these species in restored wetlands.},

	title = {Critical elements for biologically based recovery plans of aquatic-breeding amphibians},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {The global loss of biodiversity and the increasing number of threatened or endangered species have focused attention on conservation and species-recovery strategies. Because current evidence indicates that some amphibians are experiencing population declines, range constrictions, or extinctions, and federal and state agencies have listed many species as threatened or endangered, it is essential to develop sound principles upon which to base recovery plans for different ecosystems, amphibian communities, or species if we are to balance the conservation of amphibian diversity with economic development and a growing human population. I present a framework of biologically based principles that can be used for current species conservation efforts. My goal is to provide the critical elements needed to develop biologically based recovery plans for aquatic-breeding amphibians in any region. This paper is organized in three parts: (1) an overview of critical local population and landscape processes required to maintain amphibian species and threats, (2) the critical elements associated with successful recovery plans, and (3) considerations for measuring success and long-term habitat management. Clearly, we need more basic data on life-history requirements, special adaptations, habitat use, dispersal behavior, and population biology, especially factors influencing long-term persistence for many species. Nevertheless, because some species are in urgent need of conservation action, we cannot afford to wait for additional data; the most important critical elements required to initiate effective recovery efforts for amphibians are known. I hope my discussion will help managers understand the importance of incorporating local population and metapopulation factors into their recovery and restoration plans. I also hope managers begin to think about ultimate recovery and restoration strategies that consider connectivity among populations across regions and state boundaries. Only through such coordinated efforts can we really be certain that species are conserved and biodiversity is maintained.},

	abstract = {Organisms that live in highly variable environments, such as rivers, rely on adaptations to withstand and recover from disturbance. These adaptations include behavioral traits, such as habitat preference and plasticity of reproductive timing, that minimize the effects of discharge fluctuation. Studies linking hydrologic regime, habitat preference, and population processes, however, are predominantly limited to fish. Information on other sensitive taxa is necessary to facilitate conservation of multispecies assemblages and restoration of biodiversity in degraded river channels. I studied the functional relationship between physical habitat and reproduction of the foothills yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), a California State Species of Special Concern. From 1992 to 1994, I mapped breeding sites along 5.3 km of the South Fork Eel River in northern California and monitored egg survival to hatching. Frogs selected sites over a range of spatial scales and timed their egg-laying to avoid fluctuations in river stage and current velocity associated with changes in discharge. The main sources of mortality were desiccation and subsequent predation of eggs in a dry year and scour from substrate in wet years, both caused by changes in stage and velocity. At the finest spatial scale, frogs attached eggs to cobbles and boulders at lower than ambient flow velocities. At larger scales, breeding sites were near confluences of tributary drainages and were located in wide, shallow reaches. Clutches laid in relatively narrower and deeper channels had poor survival in rainy as well as dry springs. Most breeding sites were used repeatedly, despite between- and within-year variation in spring stage of the river. This pattern of site selection suggests that conservation of Rana boylii may be enhanced by maintaining or restoring channels with shapes that provide stable habitat over a range of river stages.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of wetlands comprising thousands of hectares have been restored in the Midwestern United States. In nearly all cases, restoration consisted of simply restoring wetland hydrology. For this reason, the success of these restorations relies on natural colonization. We compared the structure and composition of the vegetation in two types of wetlands: 10 natural wetlands and 17 five-to-seven-year-old restored wetlands. The overall vegetative composition of restored wetlands was different from that of natural wetlands. Restored wetland flora was formed from a subset of species found in natural wetlands. The species restricted to natural wetlands tended to be native perennials and were evenly represented along the elevational gradient. The few species that were restricted to restored wetlands were largely mudflat annuals whose presence is more indicative of the presence of more unvegetated habitat in restored wetlands than of the presence of a distinctive restored wetlands flora. In addition, restored wetlands had lower vegetative cover and species richness than natural wetlands. Both wetland types had similar numbers of exotic species at the whole wetland (4.4 species per wetland) and quadrat scale (1.5 species m(2)), and dominance of exotics increased with elevation. The lower species richness, greater compositional variability, and lack of a distinctive flora support the hypothesis that dispersal limitation is the primary cause of the differences between the vegetation in restored and natural wetlands.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {1. One of the last remnants of a functional alluvial landscape on the Danube extends from Vienna to the Slovakian frontier. It is recognized as an ecosystem extremely worthy of protection and therefore has been designated as a National Park ('Alluvial Zone National Park'). 2, However, surface connectivity has been reduced and floodplain habits have been fragmented. At present, lateral exchange processes of matter are restricted to short-term flood pulses, while most of the year backwater processes are de-coupled from the river system. 3. A very high species diversity is recorded for this section, with a high proportion of endangered species in all groups, ranging from 16\% for riparian vascular plants to 100\% for amphibians and reptiles. High diversity is mainly a result of the remaining spatial array of water bodies of different age across the river-floodplain complex (between-channel diversity). 4. A successful conservation strategy for this floodplain area requires a management scheme based on a solid conceptual foundation of the key processes in river-floodplain systems. Re-establishing hydrological dynamics is recognized as the most vital step, because other processes are influenced by the flow regime and resulting connectivity. Therefore, a large-scale pilot project has been developed for a segment of the free-flowing section to restore gradually the hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain. 5. The side-arm system will be reconnected to the main channel by lowering parts of the riverside embankments. After implementation, the side-arm system will be integrated with the flow regime of the river for more than half of an average year (at present: {\textbackslash}textless 8 days per year). 6. A key challenge in the evaluation of the effects of restoration is the development and testing of an appropriate monitoring scheme, which has to include a wide range of physical, chemical, geomorphic, and ecological parameters.

We employed indicators derived from simple, standard measures of ecosystem function selected on the basis of ecological succession theory developed by [Science 164 (1969) 262; Bioscience 35 (1985) 419], which suggests that respiration: biomass ratios should increase in disturbed systems due to the diversion of energy from growth to maintenance. This hypothesis holds potential for the development of a simple ecological indicator and therefore was tested among prairie wetlands restored after drainage disturbance. No difference was observed in respiration: biomass ratios in restored wetlands and reference wetlands designated as controls. Plankton respiration or biomass may be poor indicators of disturbance because plankton responds quickly to re-establishment of a wetland hydrology regime and/or because different plankton species may have redundant function. We suggest employing more revealing assessment techniques that employ simultaneous examination of ecosystem structure and function to better characterize subtle or lingering effects of wetland disturbance after restoration.

	abstract = {Glacial-interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene are hypothesized as one of the foremost contributors to biological diversification. This is especially true for cold-adapted montane species, where range shifts have had a pronounced effect on population-level divergence. Gartersnakes of the Thamnophis rufipunctatus species complex are restricted to cold headwater streams in the highlands of the Sierra Madre Occidental and southwestern USA. We used coalescent and multilocus phylogenetic approaches to test whether genetic diversification of this montane-restricted species complex is consistent with two prevailing models of range fluctuation for species affected by Pleistocene climate changes. Our concatenated nuDNA and multilocus species analyses recovered evidence for the persistence of multiple lineages that are restricted geographically, despite a mtDNA signature consistent with either more recent connectivity (and introgression) or recent expansion (and incomplete lineage sorting). Divergence times estimated using a relaxed molecular clock and fossil calibrations fall within the Late Pleistocene, and zero gene flow scenarios among current geographically isolated lineages could not be rejected. These results suggest that increased climate shifts in the Late Pleistocene have driven diversification and current range retraction patterns and that the differences between markers reflect the stochasticity of gene lineages (i.e. ancestral polymorphism) rather than gene flow and introgression. These results have important implications for the conservation of T. rufipunctatus (sensu novo), which is restricted to two drainage systems in the southwestern US and has undergone a recent and dramatic decline.},

We use mitochondrial sequences encoding ND1, tRNA(Leu(UUR)), and part of 16S to infer relationships among members of the Bufo americanus complex. Focusing on the four taxa that historically have been most problematic due to morphological similarity and hybridization in sympatry, we sample 150 individuals from multiple populations across each species' geographic range. Our evidence conflicts with previous taxonomic hypotheses that were based on ability to hybridize, geographic distribution, and call variation. First, sequences from B. fowleri do not comprise the sister clade to sequences of B. woodhousii; therefore the previous classifications of B. fowleri as sister species to, or eastern subspecies of, B. woodhousii are both called into question. Second, sequences from B. americanus are more closely related to those of B. woodhousii than to those of B. terrestris, indicating that similar advertisement call characteristics evolved independently. Third, sequences of B. fowleri are paraphyletic, with sequences of B. terrestris embedded within. Lastly, sequences from B. fowleri cluster into three distinct mitochondrial clades, with some divergences corresponding to greater than 2mya. These clades are somewhat geographically structured, suggesting divergence in allopatry during the Pleistocene. These mitochondrial divergences are not accompanied by known phenotypic differences, however, suggesting either evolutionary stasis in morphology and behavior, cryptic phenotypic evolution, or that hybridization in secondary contact has homogenized phenotypic differences that may have arisen in allopatry.},

Remaining populations of U. stansburiana formed two clades, corresponding to the northern and southern Baja California peninsula. Uta stellata and U. squamata occurred within the northern and southern clades, respectively.

Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

Subspecies based on phenotypic features may not comprise monophyletic groups due to selection, gene flow, and/or convergent evolution. In many taxonomic groups the number of species once designated as widespread is dwindling rapidly, and many workers reject the concept of subspecies altogether. We tested whether currently recognized subspecies in the plain-bellied watersnake Nerodia erythrogaster are concordant with relationships based on mitochondrial markers, and whether it represents a single widespread species. The range of this taxon spans multiple potential biogeographic barriers (especially the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers) that correspond with lineage breaks in many species, including other snakes. We sequenced three mitochondrial genes (NADH-II, Cyt-b, Cox-I) from 156 geo-referenced specimens and developed ecological niche models using Maxent and spatially explicit climate data to examine historical and ecological factors affecting variation in N. erythrogaster across its range. Overall, we found little support for the recognized subspecies as either independent evolutionary lineages or geographically circumscribed units and conclude that although some genetic and niche differentiation has occurred, most populations assigned to N. erythrogaster appear to represent a single, widespread species. However, additional sampling and application of nuclear markers are necessary to clarify the status of the easternmost populations.},

In recent years, the field has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of methods available for delimiting species. However, most recent investigations only utilize a handful (i.e. 2-3) of the available methods, often for unstated reasons. Because the parameter space that is potentially relevant to species delimitation far exceeds the parameterization of any existing method, a given method necessarily makes a number of simplifying assumptions, any one of which could be violated in a particular system. We suggest that researchers should apply a wide range of species delimitation analyses to their data and place their trust in delimitations that are congruent across methods. Incongruence across the results from different methods is evidence of either a difference in the power to detect cryptic lineages across one or more of the approaches used to delimit species and could indicate that assumptions of one or more of the methods have been violated. In either case, the inferences drawn from species delimitation studies should be conservative, for in most contexts it is better to fail to delimit species than it is to falsely delimit entities that do not represent actual evolutionary lineages.},

In this study, we are developing a new climatic approach by investigating the conditions that occurred before the H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks for early predicting future HPAI outbreaks and preventing pandemic disasters. The results show a temperature drop shortly before these outbreaks in birds in each of the Eurasian regions stricken in 2005 and 2006. Dust storms, like those that struck near China's Lake Qinghai around May 4, 2005, exacerbated the spread of this HPAI H5N1 virus, causing the deaths of a record number of wild birds and triggering the subsequent spread of H5N1. Weather monitoring could play an important role in the early warning of outbreaks of this potentially dangerous virus.},

Still, many IBMs are data hungry, species specific, and time-consuming to develop and analyze. Many of these issues would be resolved by using general theories of individual dynamics as the basis for IBMs. While such theories have frequently been examined at the individual level, few cross-level tests exist that also try to predict population dynamics. Here we performed a cross-level test of dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory by parameterizing an individual-based model using individual-level data of the water flea, Daphnia magna, and comparing the emerging population dynamics to independent data from population experiments. We found that DEB theory successfully predicted population growth rates and peak densities but failed to capture the decline phase. Further assumptions on food-dependent mortality of juveniles were needed to capture the population dynamics after the initial population peak. The resulting model then predicted, without further calibration, characteristic switches between small- and large-amplitude cycles, which have been observed for Daphnia. We conclude that cross-level tests help detect gaps in current individual-level theories and ultimately will lead to theory development and the establishment of a generic basis for individual-based models and ecology.},

Clinical signs in human cases indicated primarily involvement of the central nervous system, while in pigs the respiratory system was considered the primary virus target, with only rare involvement of the central nervous system. Eleven 5-week-old piglets were infected intranasally, orally, and ocularly with 2.5 x 10(5) PFU of Nipah virus per animal and euthanized between 3 and 8 days postinoculation. Nipah virus caused neurological signs in two out of eleven inoculated pigs. The rest of the pigs remained clinically healthy. Virus was detected in the respiratory system (turbinates, nasopharynx, trachea, bronchus, and lung in titers up to 10(5.3) PFU/g) and in the lymphoreticular system (endothelial cells of blood and lymphatic vessels, submandibular and bronchiolar lymph nodes, tonsil, and spleen with titers up to 10(6) PFU/g). Virus presence was confirmed in the nervous system of both sick and apparently healthy animals (cranial nerves, trigeminal ganglion, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid, with titers up to 10(7.7) PFU/g of tissue). Nipah virus distribution was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The study presents novel findings indicating that Nipah virus invaded the central nervous system of the porcine host via cranial nerves as well as by crossing the blood-brain barrier after initial virus replication in the upper respiratory tract.},

This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 ground-truthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80-90\%) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750 km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

	abstract = {Abstract Behavior is an important mechanism of evolution and it is paid for through energy expenditure. Nevertheless, field biologists can rarely observe animals for more than a fraction of their daily activities and attempts to quantify behavior for modeling ecological processes often exclude cryptic yet important behavioral events. Over the past few years, an explosion of research on remote monitoring of animal behavior using acceleration sensors has smashed the decades-old limits of observational studies. Animal-attached accelerometers measure the change in velocity of the body over time and can quantify fine-scale movements and body postures unlimited by visibility, observer bias, or the scale of space use. Pioneered more than a decade ago, application of accelerometers as a remote monitoring tool has recently surged thanks to the development of more accessible hardware and software. It has been applied to more than 120 species of animals to date. Accelerometer measurements are typically collected in three dimensions of movement at very high resolution ({\textbackslash}textgreater10 Hz), and have so far been applied towards two main objectives. First, the patterns of accelerometer waveforms can be used to deduce specific behaviors through animal movement and body posture. Second, the variation in accelerometer waveform measurements has been shown to correlate with energy expenditure, opening up a suite of scientific questions in species notoriously difficult to observe in the wild. To date, studies of wild aquatic species outnumber wild terrestrial species and analyses of social behaviors are particularly few in number. Researchers of domestic and captive species also tend to report methodology more thoroughly than those studying species in the wild. There are substantial challenges to getting the most out of accelerometers, including validation, calibration, and the management and analysis of large quantities of data. In this review, we illustrate how accelerometers work, provide an overview of the ecological questions that have employed accelerometry, and highlight the emerging best practices for data acquisition and analysis. This tool offers a level of detail in behavioral studies of free-ranging wild animals that has previously been impossible to achieve and, across scientific disciplines, it improves understanding of the role of behavioral mechanisms in ecological and evolutionary processes.

	abstract = {Animal-borne sensors enable researchers to remotely track animals, their physiological state and body movements. Accelerometers, for example, have been used in several studies to measure body movement, posture, and energy expenditure, although predominantly in marine animals. In many studies, behaviour is often inferred from expert interpretation of sensor data and not validated with direct observations of the animal. The aim of this study was to derive models that could be used to classify oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) behaviour based on sensor data. We measured the location, speed, and tri-axial acceleration of three oystercatchers using a flexible GPS tracking system and conducted simultaneous visual observations of the behaviour of these birds in their natural environment. We then used these data to develop three supervised classification trees of behaviour and finally applied one of the models to calculate time-activity budgets. The model based on accelerometer data developed to classify three behaviours (fly, terrestrial locomotion, and no movement) was much more accurate (cross-validation error = 0.14) than the model based on GPS-speed alone (cross-validation error = 0.35). The most parsimonious acceleration model designed to classify eight behaviours could distinguish five: fly, forage, body care, stand, and sit (cross-validation error = 0.28); other behaviours that were observed, such as aggression or handling of prey, could not be distinguished. Model limitations and potential improvements are discussed. The workflow design presented in this study can facilitate model development, be adapted to a wide range of species, and together with the appropriate measurements, can foster the study of behaviour and habitat use of free living animals throughout their annual routine.},

Recently, horseshoe bats in the genus Rhinolophus have been identified as natural reservoir of SARS-like coronaviruses. Here, we review studies by different groups demonstrating that SARS-CoV succeeded in spillover from a wildlife reservoir (probably bats) to human population via an intermediate host(s) and that rapid virus evolution played a key role in the adaptation of SARS-CoVs in at least two nonreservoir species within a short period.},

Some of their characteristics (food choices, colonial or solitary nature, population structure, ability to fly, seasonal migration and daily movement patterns, torpor and hibernation, life span, roosting behaviors, ability to echolocate, virus susceptibility) make them exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents. Bats of certain species are well recognized as being capable of transmitting rabies virus, but recent observations of outbreaks and epidemics of newly recognized human and livestock diseases caused by viruses transmitted by various megachiropteran and microchiropteran bats have drawn attention anew to these remarkable mammals. This paper summarizes information regarding chiropteran characteristics and information regarding 66 viruses that have been isolated from bats. From these summaries, it is clear that we do not know enough about bat biology; we are doing too little in terms of bat conservation; and there remain a multitude of questions regarding the role of bats in disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Ecologists seek to understand patterns of distribution and abundance of species. Studies of distribution often use occurrence data to build models of the environmental niche of a species. Environmental suitability (ES) derived from such models may be used to predict the potential distributions of species. The ability of such models to predict spatial patterns in abundance is unknown; we argue that there should be a positive relationship between ES and local abundance. This will be so if ES reflects how well the species' physiological and ecological requirements are met at a site and if those factors also determine local abundance. However, the presence of other factors may indicate that potential abundance is not attained at all sites. Therefore, ES should predict the upper limit of abundance, and the observed relationship with ES should be wedge shaped. We tested the relationship of ES with local abundance for 69 rain forest vertebrates in the Australian wet tropics. Ordinary least squares and quantile regressions revealed a positive relationship between ES and local abundance for most species ({\textbackslash}textgreater84\%). The relationships for these species were wedge shaped. We conclude that ES modeled from presence-only data provides useful information on spatial patterns of abundance, and we discuss implications of this in addressing important problems in ecology.},

	abstract = {Distributions of flying-fox (Pteropus alecto and P. scapulatus) were examined in relation to use of habitat in the essentially natural landscape of northern Australia. There were differences between the species in terms of the vegetation used for roosting and foraging, which were related to the reproductive cycle and seasonal variation in temperature, rainfall and the availability of preferred foods. Important habitats of P. alecto varied seasonally and included floodplain, mangrove, monsoon rainforest, Melaleuca open-forest, and Eucalyptus miniata/E. tetrodonta open-forest and woodland. The minimum scale at which conservation of P. alecto should be attempted is in the order of 5000 km2, based on seasonal patterns of habitat use. The size of this area will make conservation via traditional reserves difficult and conservation of important habitats outside reserves will be needed. Habitats protected for the benefit of P. alecto will also benefit P. scapulatus but because P. scapulatus is more mobile, displays greater yearly variation in distribution and is less well understood than P. alecto, appropriate conservation actions are less certain.},

	abstract = {Understanding foraging is important in ecology, as it determines the energy gains and, ultimately, the fitness of animals. However, monitoring prey captures of individual animals is difficult. Direct observations using animal-borne videos have short recording periods, and indirect signals (e.g., stomach temperature) are never validated in the field. We took an integrated approach to monitor prey captures by a predator by deploying a video camera (lasting for 85 min) and two accelerometers (on the head and back, lasting for 50 h) on free-swimming Adélie penguins. The movies showed that penguins moved the heads rapidly to capture krill in midwater and fish (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) underneath the sea ice. Captures were remarkably fast (two krill per second in swarms) and efficient (244 krill or 33 P. borchgrevinki in 78-89 min). Prey captures were detected by the signal of head acceleration relative to body acceleration with high sensitivity and specificity (0.83-0.90), as shown by receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Extension of signal analysis to the entire behavioral records showed that krill captures were spatially and temporally more variable than P. borchgrevinki captures. Notably, the frequency distribution of krill capture rate closely followed a power-law model, indicating that the foraging success of penguins depends on a small number of very successful dives. The three steps illustrated here (i.e., video observations, linking video to behavioral signals, and extension of signal analysis) are unique approaches to understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecologically important events such as foraging.},

Statistical inference based on such data are likely to be inefficient or wrong unless careful thought is given to how these zeros arose and how best to model them. In this paper, we propose a framework for understanding how zero-inflated data sets originate and deciding how best to model them. We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from 'true zero' or 'false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

	abstract = {Sampling bias is a common phenomenon in records of plant and animal distribution. Yet, models based on such records usually ignore the potential implications of bias in data collection on the accuracy of model predictions. This study was designed to investigate the effect of roadside bias, one of the most common sources of bias in biodiversity databases, on the accuracy of predictive maps produced by bioclimatic models. Using data on the distribution of 129 species of woody plants in Israel, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) that data collected on woody plant distribution in Israel suffer from roadside bias, (2) that such bias affects the accuracy of model predictions, (3) that the road network of Israel is biased with respect to climatic conditions, and (4) that the impact of roadside bias on model predictions depends on the magnitude of climatic bias in the geographic distribution of the road network. As expected, the frequency of plant observations near roads was consistently greater than that expected from a spatially random distribution. This bias was most pronounced at distances of 500-2000 m from roads, but it was statistically significant also at larger scales. Predictive maps based on near-road observations were less accurate than those based on off-road or "rectified" observations (observations corrected for roadside bias). However, the magnitude of these differences was extremely low, indicating that even a strong bias in the distribution of species observations does not necessarily deteriorate the accuracy of predictive maps generated by bioclimatic models. Further analysis of the data indicated that the road network of Israel is relatively unbiased in terms of temperature, and only weakly biased in terms of rainfall conditions. The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impact of roadside bias on model predictions depends on the magnitude of climatic bias in the geographic distribution of the road network. We discuss some theoretical and practical considerations of bias correction in biodiversity databases.},

	abstract = {Influenza A incidence peaks during winter in temperate regions. The basis for this pronounced seasonality is not understood, nor is it well documented how influenza A transmission principally occurs. Previous studies indicate that relative humidity (RH) affects both influenza virus transmission (IVT) and influenza virus survival (IVS). Here, we reanalyze these data to explore the effects of absolute humidity on IVT and IVS. We find that absolute humidity (AH) constrains both transmission efficiency and IVS much more significantly than RH. In the studies presented, 50\% of IVT variability and 90\% of IVS variability are explained by AH, whereas, respectively, only 12\% and 36\% are explained by RH. In temperate regions, both outdoor and indoor AH possess a strong seasonal cycle that minimizes in winter. This seasonal cycle is consistent with a wintertime increase in IVS and IVT and may explain the seasonality of influenza. Thus, differences in AH provide a single, coherent, more physically sound explanation for the observed variability of IVS, IVT and influenza seasonality in temperate regions. This hypothesis can be further tested through future, additional laboratory, epidemiological and modeling studies.},

It is found to be generally superior if diurnal forcing is present and very much superior to the use of the insulated surface assumption. An analogous method of predicting ground surface moisture content is presented which allows the surface to become moist quickly during rainfall or to become drier than the bulk soil while evaporation occurs. These improved methods are not of much relevance unless the main influences of a vegetation layer are included. An efficient one-layer foliage parameterization is therefore developed that extends continuously from the case of no shielding of the ground by vegetation to complete shielding. It includes influences of both ground and foliage albedos and emissivlties, net leaf area index, stomatal resistance, retained water on the foliage, and several other considerations. When it is tested against data for wheat measured by Penman and Long (1960), it appears quite adequate despite the many simplifying assumptions. The parameterization predicts that errors of up to a factor of 2 in evapotranspiration can be incurred by ignoring the presence of a vegetation layer.},

	abstract = {Forest microclimate has been monitored continuously for more than 3 yr at two sites in deciduous woodland at Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK. Automatic weather stations provided hourly data for wind speed, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and, in particular, temperature at different heights above the ground and at different depths in the soil. These data were compared with values from an open site at the same location. Air temperatures could be up to 3??C lower under the canopy than at the open site under sunny conditions in summer, but the differences averaged 0.6 and 0.9??C during the summer months and barely differed over winter. Effects of forest cover on soil temperatures were much greater and under the woodland they neither fell below 0??C nor rose above 20??C even at 5 mm depth, in contrast to temperatures under bare earth and grass. The temperature of a grass tussock at the soil surface under the canopy was intermediate between soil and air temperature; in comparison to grassland plants at an open site it experienced a much smaller range of temperatures. The differences between both soil and air temperature under the canopy and in the open were significantly correlated with solar radiation, presence or absence of canopy leaves and wind speed. Soil water content had no significant effect on soil temperature, partly because thermal diffusivity was relatively insensitive to it and partly because soil heat flux was small. Seasonal changes in canopy leaf cover caused a large peak of PAR under the canopy in spring prior to bud burst in trees and a much smaller one in the autumn after leaf fall. Wind speed under the canopy was also affected by the presence of leaves and was proportionally lower in summer and autumn than winter and spring.},

We performed an intensive capture-mark-recapture study across seasons and years to investigate the effect of chytridiomycosis on demographics in 2 populations of the threatened common mist frog (Litoria rheocola) in the lowland wet tropics of Queensland, Australia. Infection prevalence was the best predictor for apparent survival probability in adult males and varied widely with season (0-65\%). Infection prevalence was highest in winter months when monthly survival probabilities were low (approximately 70\%). Populations at both sites exhibited very low annual survival probabilities (12-15\%) but high recruitment (71-91\%), which resulted in population growth rates that fluctuated seasonally. Our results suggest that even in the absence of observed mortalities and continued declines, and despite host-pathogen co-existence for multiple host generations over almost 2 decades, chytridiomycosis continues to have substantial seasonally fluctuating population-level effects on amphibian survival, which necessitates increased recruitment for population persistence. Similarly infected populations may thus be under continued threat from chytridiomycosis which may render them vulnerable to other threatening processes, particularly those affecting recruitment success.},

	abstract = {A major observed and predicted impact of climate change on marine species is the poleward shift in their distributions and the resulting changes in community structure. Here, we used a Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model to project range shift of exploited marine fishes and invertebrates in Western Australia. We combined published data and expert knowledge to predict current species distributions for 30 tropical, sub-tropical and temperate species that occur along the coast of Western Australia. Using outputs from both a Regional Oceanographic Model and a Global Circulation Model, we simulated change in the distribution of each species. Our study shows that under the SRES (Special Report for Emission Scenarios) A1B scenario, the median rate of distribution shift is around 19 km decade–1 towards higher latitudes and 9 m deeper decade–1 by 2055 relative to 2005. As a result, species gains and losses are expected along the south coast and north coast of Western Australia, respectively. Also, the coast of Western Australia is expected to experience a ‘tropicalisation' of the marine community in the future, with increasing dominance of warmer-water species. Such changes in species assemblages may have large ecological and socio-economic implications through shifts in fishing grounds and unexpected trophic effects.},

	abstract = {The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In field experiments manipulating generalist pathogens and host community composition, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species drove disease dynamics in multiple nonreservoir species, sometimes decreasing their abundance through apparent competition. The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen-mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes recent research in Australia on: (i) climate and geophysical trends over the last few decades; (ii) projections for climate change in the 21st century; (iii) predicted impacts from modelling studies on particular ecosystems and native species; and (iv) ecological effects that have apparently occurred as a response to recent warming. Consistent with global trends, Australia has warmed similar to0.8degreesC over the last century with minimum temperatures warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0degreesC by 2030 (relative to 1990) and 1.0-6.0degreesC by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains as to future changes in rainfall, El Nino Southern Oscillation events and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth, alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis programs such as bioclim consistently predicts contraction and/or fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely with as little as 0.5-1.0degreesC of warming. Australia lacks the long-term datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere. Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends, such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component. Shifts in species distributions toward the south (bats, birds), upward in elevation (alpine mammals) or along changing rainfall contours (birds, semiarid reptiles), have recently been documented and offer circumstantial evidence that temperature and rainfall trends are already affecting geographic ranges. Future research directions suggested include giving more emphasis to the study of climatic impacts and understanding the factors that control species distributions, incorporating the effects of elevated CO2 into climatic modelling for vegetation and selecting suitable species as indicators of climate-induced change.},

The per capita incidence of dengue was lower in Ho Chi Minh City than in most rural provinces; an- nual epidemics occurred 1–3 months later in Ho Chi Minh City than elsewhere. The timing and the magnitude of an- nual epidemics were significantly more correlated in nearby districts than in remote districts, suggesting that local bio- logical and ecologic drivers operate at a scale of 50–100 km. Dengue incidence during the dry season accounted for 63\% of variability in epidemic magnitude.

	abstract = {Flying-foxes (Pteropodidae) are large bats capable of long-distance flight. Many species are threatened; some are considered pests. Effective conservation and management of flying-foxes are constrained by lack of knowledge of their ecology, especially of movement patterns over large spatial scales. Using satellite telemetry, we quantified long-distance movements of the grey-headed flying-fox Pteropus poliocephalus among roost sites in eastern Australia. Fourteen adult males were tracked for 2-40 weeks (mean 25 weeks). Collectively, these individuals utilised 77 roost sites in an area spanning 1,075 km by 128 km. Movement patterns varied greatly between individuals, with some travelling long distances. Five individuals travelled cumulative distances {\textbackslash}textgreater1,000 km over the study period. Five individuals showed net displacements {\textbackslash}textgreater300 km during one month, including one movement of 500 km within 48 hours. Seasonal movements were consistent with facultative latitudinal migration in part of the population. Flying-foxes shifted roost sites frequently: 64\% of roost visits lasted {\textbackslash}textless5 consecutive days, although some individuals remained at one roost for several months. Modal 2-day distances between consecutive roosts were 21-50 km (mean 45 km, range 3-166 km). Of 13 individuals tracked for {\textbackslash}textgreater12 weeks, 10 moved {\textbackslash}textgreater100 km in one or more weeks. Median cumulative displacement distances over 1, 10 and 30 weeks were 0 km, 260 km and 821 km, respectively. On average, over increasing time-periods, one additional roost site was visited for each additional 100 km travelled. These findings explain why culling and relocation attempts have had limited success in resolving human-bat conflicts in Australia. Flying-foxes are highly mobile between camps and regularly travel long distances. Consequently, local control actions are likely to have only temporary effects on local flying-fox populations. Developing alternative methods to manage these conflicts remains an important challenge that should be informed by a better understanding of the species' movement patterns.},

	abstract = {Most spiders use venom to paralyze their prey and are commonly feared for their potential to cause injury to humans. In North America, one species in particular, Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider, Sicariidae), causes the majority of necrotic wounds induced by the Araneae. However, its distributional limitations are poorly understood and, as a result, medical professionals routinely misdiagnose brown recluse bites outside endemic areas, confusing putative spider bites for other serious conditions. To address the issue of brown recluse distribution, we employ ecological niche modeling to investigate the present and future distributional potential of this species. We delineate range boundaries and demonstrate that under future climate change scenarios, the spider's distribution may expand northward, invading previously unaffected regions of the USA. At present, the spider's range is centered in the USA, from Kansas east to Kentucky and from southern Iowa south to Louisiana. Newly influenced areas may include parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These results illustrate a potential negative consequence of climate change on humans and will aid medical professionals in proper bite identification/treatment, potentially reducing bite misdiagnoses.},

	abstract = {In field experiments manipulating generalist pathogens and host community composition, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species drove disease dynamics in multiple nonreservoir species, sometimes decreasing their abundance through apparent competition. The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen-mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.},

	abstract = {In the face of environmental change, species can evolve new physiological tolerances to cope with altered climatic conditions or move spatially to maintain existing physiological associations with particular climates that define each species' climatic niche. When environmental change occurs over short temporal and large spatial scales, vagile species are expected to move geographically by tracking their climatic niches through time. Here, we test for evidence of niche tracking in bird species of the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, focusing on 53 species resurveyed nearly a century apart at 82 sites on four elevational transects. Changes in climate and bird distributions resulted in focal species shifting their average climatological range over time. By comparing the directions of these shifts relative to the centroids of species' range-wide climatic niches, we found that 48 species (90.6\%) tracked their climatic niche. Analysis of niche sensitivity on an independent set of occurrence data significantly predicted the temperature and precipitation gradients tracked by species. Furthermore, in 50 species (94.3\%), site-specific occupancy models showed that the position of each site relative to the climatic niche centroid explained colonization and extinction probabilities better than a null model with constant probabilities. Combined, our results indicate that the factors limiting a bird species' range in the Sierra Nevada in the early 20th century also tended to drive changes in distribution over time, suggesting that climatic models derived from niche theory might be used successfully to forecast where and how to conserve species in the face of climate change.},

The mares ate large quantities of forage (21.9 +/- 2.4 kg of organic matter per day, i.e. 166.2 +/- 20.8 g of organic matter per kg LW0.75 per day) in comparison with previous published values and with the estimated requirements of these horses.

This behaviour maintained the plants at young growing stages which are of better quality than ungrazed plants. These results are discussed in relation to the dynamics of the plant communities.},

	abstract = {Foraging behaviour (grazing time, diet selection) and overlap in vegetation use between five beef cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 does, suckling their offspring born in late winter-early spring, was compared across the grazing season (May-December). Animals were managed in mixed grazing on heather-gorse vegetation communities with an adjacent area (24\%) of ryegrass-clover improved pasture. Equines spent more daily time grazing than the other species in all seasons, averaging 610. min/day compared to 530, 481 and 496. min/day spent by cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. Seasonal changes in both grazing behaviour and diet selection were observed. Generally, cows, mares and ewes spent most of their grazing time on the improved pasture (0.77, 0.73 and 0.59, respectively), whereas goats spent more time grazing on shrublands (0.70). All species concentrated their diurnal grazing activity in the morning and late afternoon, whilst resting occurred mainly in the middle of the day. Herbaceous species were the main component in the diets of cattle, equines and sheep across the whole grazing season, whereas for goats this predominance was only observed during the spring. Cattle, sheep and equines turned to browse only when pasture availability decreased. Cattle and sheep tended to select heather in moderate amounts whereas they avoided gorse across the grazing season. By contrast, horses seemed to be able to deal with the gorse spiny shoots and consumed it in the autumn (averaging 0.29). The goats' diet at the end of the grazing season was mainly composed of heather species, reaching 0.81 in November. Degree of grazing overlap between livestock species was influenced by the animal species and also varied across the grazing season. The greatest similarity indexes (KSI) based on grazing time and diet composition data were found between cattle and equines (0.86) and between cattle and sheep (0.94), whereas the combination of goats with the other animal species resulted in lower KSI values. Dietary overlap decreased as the improved pasture availability decreased during the grazing season. Results suggest that the success of management strategies (type and composition of the flock, mixed or sequential, continuous or seasonal) in these heterogeneous vegetation conditions will depend on plant species characteristics and its proportions. Grazing management options should be based on production (animal performance) or environmental goals (biodiversity, control of shrub encroachment, reduction of fire risk, etc.) previously defined. Goats proved to be the best complement to the other animal species for an efficient use of natural vegetation. Nevertheless, studies should be carried out to assess the interactions between grazing behaviour and animal performance in these particular vegetation conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {1. Equids are generalist herbivores that co-exist with bovids of similar body size in many ecosystems. There are two major hypotheses to explain their co-existence, but few comparative data are available to test them. The first postulates that the very different functioning of their digestive tracts leads to fundamentally different patterns of use of grasses of different fibre contents. The second postulates resource partitioning through the use of different plant species. As domestic horses and cattle are used widely in Europe for the management of conservation areas, particularly in wetlands, a good knowledge of their foraging behaviour and comparative nutrition is necessary. 2. In this paper we describe resource-use by horses and cattle in complementary studies in two French wetlands. Horses used marshes intensively during the warmer seasons. both species used grasslands intensively throughout the year; cattle used forbs and shrubs much more than horses. Niche breadth was similar and overlap was high (Kulczinski's index 0.58-0.77). Horses spent much more time feeding on short grass than cattle. These results from the two sites indicate strong potential for competition. 3. Comparative daily food intake. measured in the field during this study for the first time, was 63\% higher in horses (144 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)) than in cattle (88 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)). Digestibility of the cattle diets was a little higher. but daily intake of digestible dry matter (i.e. nutrient extraction) in all seasons was considerably higher in horses (78 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day (-1)) than in cattle (51 g(DM) kg W-0.75 day(-1)). When food is limiting. horses should outcompete cattle in habitats dominated by grasses because their functional response is steeper: under these circumstances cattle will require an ecological refuge for survival during winter, woodland or shrubland with abundant dicotyledons. 4. Horses are a good tool for plant management because they remove more vegetation per unit body weight than cattle. and use the most productive plant communities and plant species (especially graminoids) to a greater extent. They feed closer to the ground, and maintain a mosaic of patches of short and tall grass that contributes to structural diversity at this scale. Cattle use broadleaved plants to a greater extent than horses, and can reduce the rate of encroachment by certain woody species.},

	abstract = {Foraging herbivores are often faced with spatial and temporal heterogeneity within the vegetation they have available to graze and therefore have to make decisions where and when to graze. The study reported in this paper investigated the influence of sward height on diet selection by horses grazing perennial rye-grass swards. The study comprised two experiments. In Experiment 1, perennial rye-grass paddocks were mown to four sward heights (heights: 3.5, 4.5, 7.5 and 15 cm) to create a patchy environment. Within each paddock one horse grazed for a period of 1 h during which residence time, number of bites and frequency of visits per patch were recorded. This was replicated with all seven horses used in the experiment. The same experiment was repeated in Experiment 2, but without mowing the field and allowing 1 week of re-growth for each paddock. During both experiments horses entered equally often but resided significantly longer on patches with long grass (15 cm) than on those with short grass (below 4.5 cm; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Grazing time and number of bites on a patch were highly correlated. The number of bites on patches with the highest sward height was greater than that on short patches (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Horses behaved as selective grazers, feeding mainly on grass taller than 7 cm. In Experiment 2, re-growth of the sward reduced the difference in sward height between the patches. Time spent per patch and total numbers of bites taken were less affected by sward height than in Experiment 1. It is suggested that horses behaved as energy maximisers (residing longer periods on patches and increasing number of bites taken). These data complement previous findings that bite dimension and bite mass increase with increasing sward height. When grazing, a horse rarely resided on a preferred patch for a long duration of time (maximum 305 s, median 79 s), but moved on after a few minutes. They sampled their environment continuously, but almost exclusively returned to long patches for feeding. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The numbers of horses grazing at pasture are increasing in developed countries, so a proper understanding of their feeding selectivity and of the tactics they use for extracting nutrients from swards is essential for the management of horses and grasslands. Resource acquisition in herbivores can be optimised through the modulation of their intake and patch selection, both being strongly dependent on the characteristics of swards. However, the principles by which horses adjust their grazing behaviour in response to variations in sward features are not completely understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether the behaviour of horses conforms to optimal foraging models. We hypothesized that, faced with binary choices between vegetative swards of a good and similar quality at three different heights, horses would select the taller sward, i.e. that allowing a higher reward in terms of dry matter intake rate. Three groups of three 2-year-old saddle horses were grazed on a semi-natural pasture that was managed to produce three contrasting sward heights at 6, 11 and 17 cm, in a Latin-square design. The instantaneous intake rate was determined from bite rate measured at pasture on the three sward heights, and bite mass estimated from measurements using swards offered indoors in experimental trays. Daily dry matter intake was estimated individually by total faecal collection and an estimation of digestibility from faecal nitrogen. Short-term (first 30 min) and daily preferences were assessed from the time spent grazing each sward offered in pair-wise tests at pasture. The results show that daily voluntary intake (an average of 21 g DM kg LW-1 day-1) and total grazing time (an average of 14 h day-1) were independent of sward height and of the choice of patches offered. In choice situations, the animals spent more time grazing on the taller sward, both during the first 30 min and at the daily scale. These results show that horses choose between vegetative patches of a good and similar quality according to the predictions from optimal foraging models, and select the one that they can ingest faster. Further research will now have to explore how the horses will adapt their feeding behaviour when they face a trade-off between sward height and quality. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In contrast to horses in pastures, it is thought that free-ranging horses do not perform latrine behaviour, i.e. a behavioural pattern whereby the animals graze and defecate in separate areas. However, few studies deal with this particular subject, reporting contrasting conclusions. We hypothesize that horses free-ranging in large heterogeneous areas do not perform latrine behaviour. Thus, we believe that grazing and elimination behaviour are spatially related: where horses graze, they will also defecate. Behavioural data were collected from Konik horses, Haflinger horses, Shetland ponies and donkeys, grazing in different nature reserves (54-80ha). Data for the different equids were analyzed separately, as well as data for mares and stallions (Konik and donkey stallions only). We investigated the proportion of the number of defecations/urinations while grazing on the total number of defecations/ urinations; furthermore, we searched for the sequence of behaviours representing latrine behaviour in the strict sense. Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between grazing behaviour and eliminative behaviour on both vegetation type level and patch level. All the female equids often continued grazing while defecating. During urination, grazing ceases in the majority of instances. Cases where a mare terminated grazing in a certain vegetation type and sward height to eliminate in another vegetation type or in another sward height within the same vegetation type were rarely observed. On the vegetation type level as well as on the patch level, there was a highly significant (P{\textbackslash}textless0.001) positive correlation between grazing time and number of eliminations (or eliminating time). The high values of the correlation coefficients (in case of the defecation variables r ranges between 0.553 and 0.955; in case of the urination variables r ranges between 0.370 and 0.839) illustrate that the spatial distribution of the eliminative behaviour can be explained to a high degree by the spatial distribution of the grazing behaviour. Results in the case of the stallions are preliminary, but indicate the same pattern. Horses, free-ranging in large heterogeneous areas, do not perform latrine behaviour, but defecate where they graze. Possibly, animal density is of major importance to explain this behavioural difference with horses in pastures. We suggest that also spatial vegetation heterogeneity and plant productivity of the grazed area, as well as parasite status of the grazing animals could play a role. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this experiment was to measure the effect on behaviour of providing six gilts with a foraging device (The 'Edinburgh Foodball' British Patent No. 9200499.3) which was designed to deliver small food rewards, relatively randomly in space, time and quantity, in response to being rooted. The following treatments were sequentially applied: Baseline (B) (2.0 kg of standard sow diet given on the floor and no Foodball), Foodball (Fb) (2.0 kg floor fed; Foodball containing 5.0 kg), Extinction (E) (2.0 kg floor fed; Foodball without food) and Food (Fd) (2.0 kg floor fed; plus matched amount of food during Fb tests). Testing began at 08:30 h when gilts were floor fed, videoing continued between 09:00 and 17:00 h. On the Fb treatment gilts obtained a mean of 2608 g (s.e.m. 257) food in a mean of 112.8 min (s.e.m. 15.8), indicating that gilts fed a commercial size ration were still highly food motivated. The results showed that foraging activities were not significantly different for treatments B, Fb and E, but were significantly lower on Fd. This shows that it is not food level per se that determines foraging activity, but also the method of food presentation. On the Fb treatment pigs walked for more observations than on other treatments. Also on the Fb treatment straw directed behaviour appeared to be replaced by Foodball directed behaviour. The 'Edinburgh Foodball' appears to be a useful device in allowing gilts to express foraging behaviour. ?? 1994.},

The grazing and eliminative behaviour patterns of domestic horses are unlike those of free-ranging Equidae. The reasons for this are not known, but it can cause wasted grazing of up to 90\% of a field. Certain conditions, such as provision of supplementary hay and lack of available herbage, can cause these behaviour patterns to change, although it is not known how to manipulate the grazing behaviour of horses to prevent deterioration of the pasture. Grazing behaviour is influenced by many variables and is more complex than the feeding behaviour of a stabled horse. Horses sleep for approximately 12\% of the day and show 4 different sleep/wakefulness states - alert wakefulness, drowsiness, slow-wave sleep and paradoxical sleep. Horses are able to maintain slow-wave sleep while standing, but they need to lie down for paradoxical sleep to occur, rarely spending more than 30 consecutive minutes in lateral recumbency. ?? 1983.},

In both these treatment periods nine (three cold blood and six warm blood) adult horses were exposed to all the three paddock size treatments for 2 h daily, for 1 week in each paddock size, and the order of paddock size treatments were rotated systematically. In between turnout in paddocks the horses were all housed in tie stalls. In the non-exercise period the horses walked significantly more, they travelled a longer distance, explored more and stood more alert, than in the period with exercise. The horses stood less passively in the large paddock compared to the medium and the small paddock, and they also travelled a longer distance in the larger paddock sizes. At days with heavy rain and wind, the horses were more restless and walked significantly more than in warmer weather. In conclusion; daily exercise significantly reduced the general activity in the paddocks. Increasing the paddock size to 450 m2, increased the time spent eating grass from under the fence and decreased the time spent standing passively. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of grasslands determines the abundance and quality of food resources for grazing animals. As plants mature, they increase in mass, which allows greater instantaneous intake rates, but the cell wall concentrations increase too, reducing diet quality. In ruminants, daily intake rates are often constrained by the time needed for the ingesta to pass through the rumen, which is influenced by the rate of digestion. It has been suggested that the digestive constraint should have much less effect on hindgut fermenters such as equids. Horses play an increasing role in the management of grasslands in Europe, but the data on the influence of the heterogeneity of the vegetation on their daily intake and foraging behaviour are sparse. We report here the results of a preliminary study concerning the effects of sward structure on nutrient assimilation and the use of patches of different heights by horses grazing successively a short immature, a tall mature and a heterogeneous pastures (with short and tall swards). Daily nutrient assimilation was higher in the heterogeneous pasture compared to the short (+35\%) and the tall (+55\%) ones. The digestive constraints may have limited voluntary intake by horses on the tall swards. In the heterogeneous pasture, the mean height used for feeding (6 to 7 cm) by horses was intermediate between the heights used in the short (4 to 5 cm) and tall pastures (22 to 23 cm), and the animals may thus have benefited from both short swards of high quality and tall swards offering a higher instantaneous intake rate.},

	abstract = {Management of grazed grasslands for production and/or conservation objectives requires a thorough understanding of the choices of feeding sites by herbivores, and of the biological processes involved. Most models of the feeding strategies of herbivores are based on the principle that optimising the intake of energy (or some nutrient) is the primary goal of foragers but other selective forces, such as parasitism, could be important. Gastrointestinal parasites (including cyathostome nematodes) have powerful effects on the fitness of herbivores and may act as a major selection pressure favouring host behaviour that reduces the risk of encountering parasites. Among large herbivores, horses have perhaps the most marked tendency to select particular feeding sites within grasslands. We test here: (1) whether horses select feeding patches with relatively low parasite densities and (2) if their choice is affected by their parasite load. We used 10 two-year old saddle-horses and three periods. In the first period, the horses were under natural parasitism which varied strongly among individuals; in the second period they were all dewormed, and in the third, a sub-set of the horses was experimentally infected with cyathostome larvae. Ninety-eight percent of the infective larvae in the pasture were found {\textbackslash}textless1 m from faeces. The main determinant of the choice of feeding patch by horses was the availability of patches of different parasite risk and grass height. Controlling for availability, the horses used tall grasses ({\textbackslash}textgreater16 cm) less than expected, whether the grass was contaminated or not, and they selected for short patches {\textbackslash}textgreater1 m from faeces, where the risk of encountering parasites was low. These results suggest that selection of feeding sites by horses is driven by an interaction between their nutritional and anti-parasite strategies: the horses avoid the patches of tall grass which are generally of low quality and areas contaminated by parasite larvae which leads them to prefer the patches of short grass far from faeces. The parasite status of the horses at the time of the experiment had no effect on their feeding choices. However, before concluding that the challenge by cyathostomes has no effect on the selection of feeding sites in horses, it will be necessary to test whether the history of parasitism of the individuals, rather than the current status, is important. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Although physical features, amount and distribution of free water, and insect densities differed between the 2 study sites, horses displayed similar seasonal and daily patterns of habitat use. In the island horses, the rate of tail swishing/min was used as a crude measure of insect harassment. This behavior occurred least at beach and bay sites. These sites, in addition to the ocean, were used most during the summer, particularly between 10.00 to 16.00 h. In the desert population, the horses grazed in meadows early in the day when it was cooler and pest densities were lower. Movements shifted during the day, and horses rested on higher slopes and ridges primarily during the afternoon. Two new refuges for energy conservation were observed, viz. inshore water and snow patches. Resting occurred often in each of these areas. ?? 1982.},

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID 'events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8\%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease 'hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate},

More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.},

Major deletions were observed in the Orf8 region of the genome, both at the start and the end of the epidemic. The neutral mutation rate of the viral genome was constant but the amino acid substitution rate of the coding sequences slowed during the course of the epidemic. The spike protein showed the strongest initial responses to positive selection pressures, followed by subsequent purifying selection and eventual stabilization.},

We present analyses of data on key parameters and distributions and discuss the processes of data capture, analysis and public health policy formulation during the SARS epidemic are discussed. The low transmissibility of the virus, combined with the onset of peak infectiousness following the onset of clinical symptoms of disease, transpired to make simple public health measures, such as isolating patients and quarantining their contacts, very effective in the control of the SARS epidemic. We conclude that we were lucky this time round, but may not be so with the next epidemic outbreak of a novel aetiological agent. We present analyses that help to further understanding of what intervention measures are likely to work best with infectious agents of defined biological and epidemiological properties.

	abstract = {The extant amphibians are one of the most diverse radiations of terrestrial vertebrates ({\textbackslash}textgreater6800 species). Despite much recent focus on their conservation, diversification, and systematics, no previous phylogeny for the group has contained more than 522 species. However, numerous studies with limited taxon sampling have generated large amounts of partially overlapping sequence data for many species. Here, we combine these data and produce a novel estimate of extant amphibian phylogeny, containing 2871 species (∼40\% of the known extant species) from 432 genera (∼85\% of the ∼500 currently recognized extant genera). Each sampled species contains up to 12,712 bp from 12 genes (three mitochondrial, nine nuclear), with an average of 2563 bp per species. This data set provides strong support for many groups recognized in previous studies, but it also suggests non-monophyly for several currently recognized families, particularly in hyloid frogs (e.g., Ceratophryidae, Cycloramphidae, Leptodactylidae, Strabomantidae). To correct these and other problems, we provide a revised classification of extant amphibians for taxa traditionally delimited at the family and subfamily levels. This new taxonomy includes several families not recognized in current classifications (e.g., Alsodidae, Batrachylidae, Rhinodermatidae, Odontophrynidae, Telmatobiidae), but which are strongly supported and important for avoiding non-monophyly of current families. Finally, this study provides further evidence that the supermatrix approach provides an effective strategy for inferring large-scale phylogenies using the combined results of previous studies, despite many taxa having extensive missing data.},

	title = {Effects of fathead minnows and restoration on prairie wetland ecosystems},
	volume = {47},
	abstract = {1. Research has shown that fish influence the structure and processes of aquatic ecosystems, but replicated studies at the ecosystem level are rare as are those involving wetlands. Some wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America support fish communities dominated by fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) while others are fishless, providing an opportunity to assess the influence of these fish on wetland ecosystems. Additionally, many wetlands have previously been drained and subsequently restored, but the success of these efforts is poorly known and restoration may be impeded by the presence of fish. 2. We assessed the effects of fathead minnows and drainage by studying 20 semipermanent, prairie wetlands in Minnesota from 1996 to 1999. We used a 2 x 2 factorial design to examine the effects of presence and absence of minnows and drainage history (restored never drained) on the abundance of aquatic invertebrates and amphibians, as well as on the concentrations of chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and turbidity in the water column. 3. Results showed that fathead minnows are an important determinant of many biotic and abiotic characteristics of wetlands in the eastern PPR. Wetlands with fathead minnows had fewer aquatic insects, large- and small-bodied cladocerans, calanoid copepods, ostracods and larval tiger salamanders, as well as a higher abundance of corixids and greater turbidity and chlorophyll a. A higher concentration of phosphorus in restored basins was the only consistent effect of past management. 4. Fathead minnows usually dominate fish communities in eastern PPR wetlands where fish are present, and can have several strong ecosystem effects. While abiotic variables are important determinants of ecosystem structure in prairie wetlands, they can be strongly influenced by biotic factors.},

	abstract = {A long history of human-induced degradation of Great Lakes wetlands has made restoration a necessity, but the practice of wetland restoration is relatively new, especially in large lake systems. Therefore, we compiled tested methods and developed additional potential methods based on scientific understanding of Great Lakes wetland ecosystems to provide an overview of approaches for restoration. We addressed this challenge by focusing on four general fields of science: hydrology, sedimentology, chemistry, and biology. Hydrologic remediation methods include restoring hydrologic connections between diked and hydrologically altered wetlands and the lakes, restoring water tables lowered by ditching, and restoring natural variation in lake levels of regulated lakes Superior and Ontario. Sedimentological remediation methods include management of sediment input from uplands, removal or proper management of dams on tributary rivers, and restoration of protective barrier beaches and sand spits. Chemical remediation methods include reducing or eliminating inputs of contaminants from point and non-point sources, natural sediment remediation by biodegradation and chemical degradation, and active sediment remediation by removal or by in situ treatment. Biological remediation methods include control of non-target organisms, enhancing populations of target organisms, and enhancing habitat for target organisms. Some of these methods were used in three major restoration projects (Metzger Marsh on Lake Erie and Cootes Paradise and Oshawa Second Marsh on Lake Ontario), which are described as case studies to show practical applications of wetland restoration in the Great Lakes. Successful restoration techniques that do not require continued manipulation must be founded in the basic tenets of ecology and should mimic natural processes. Success is demonstrated by the sustainability, productivity, nutrient-retention ability, invasibility, and biotic interactions within a restored wetland.},

	abstract = {We used data from a statewide frog monitoring network to investigate population turnover and synchrony in eight wetland-breeding species. We found that subpopulations at many sites turn over frequently, with breeding choruses absent or undetectable in most years. Frequencies of detection across sites were significantly associated with the density of wetland patches (all species) and the areal extent of several terrestrial land cover categories (seven species) within 1 km. Intraspecific population fluctuations were statistically synchronized between survey sites separated by up to 50-100 km, but synchrony was not strong. Anuran abundances were significantly correlated with rainfall 1-4 years earlier, indicating that rainfall influences population fluctuations. However, population synchrony was much weaker than rainfall synchrony. Managers attempting to maintain amphibian populations regionally should focus on maintaining landscapes with high densities of wetlands and sufficient upland habitat resources. The dynamic nature of amphibian populations at individual wetlands is well known, and our results suggest that species distributions at the landscape level are similarly dynamic.},

	abstract = {Identification of species in natural populations has recently received increased attention with a number of investigators proposing rigorous methods for species delimitation. Morphologically conservative species (or species complexes) with deep phylogenetic histories (and limited gene flow) are likely to pose particular problems when attempting to delimit species, yet this is crucial to comparative studies of the geography of speciation. We apply two methods of species delimitation to an ancient group of lizards (genus Xantusia) that occur throughout southwestern North America. Mitochondrial cytochrome b and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene sequences were generated from samples taken throughout the geographic range of Xantusia. Maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and nested cladogram analyses were used to estimate relationships among haplotypes and to infer evolutionary processes. We found multiple well-supported independent lineages within Xantusia, for which there is considerable discordance with the currently recognized taxonomy. High levels of sequence divergence (21.3\%) suggest that the pattern in Xantusia may predate the vicariant events usually hypothesized for the fauna of the Baja California peninsula, and the existence of deeply divergent clades (18.8\%-26.9\%) elsewhere in the complex indicates the occurrence of ancient sundering events whose genetic signatures were not erased by the late Wisconsin vegetation changes. We present a revised taxonomic arrangement for this genus consistent with the distinct mtDNA lineages and discuss the phylogeographic history of this genus as a model system for studies of speciation in North American deserts.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Despite concern about the conservation status of amphibians in western North America, few field studies have documented occurrence patterns of amphibians relative to potential stressors. We surveyed wetland fauna in Oregon's Willamette Valley and used an information theoretic approach (AIC) to rank the associations between native amphibian breeding occurrence and wetland characteristics, non-native aquatic predators, and landscape characteristics in a mixed urban-agricultural landscape. Best predictors varied among the five native amphibians and were generally consistent with life history differences. Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) and long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) occurrence was best predicted by the absence of non-native fish. Northern red-legged frog (Rana a. aurora) and northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) were most strongly related to wetland vegetative characteristics. The occurrence of rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), a migratory species that makes extensive use of terrestrial habitats, was best predicted by greater forest cover within 1 km. The absence of non-native fish was a strong predictor of occurrence for four of the five native species. In contrast, amphibians were not strongly related to native fish presence. We found little evidence supporting negative effects of the presence of breeding populations of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) on any native species. Only the two Ambystoma salamanders were associated with wetland permanence. Northwestern salamanders (which usually have a multi-year larval stage) were associated with permanent waters, while long-toed salamanders were associated with temporary wetlands. Although all the species make some use of upland habitats, only one (rough-skinned newt) was strongly associated with surrounding landscape conditions. Instead, our analysis suggests that within-wetland characteristics best predict amphibian occurrence in this region. We recommend that wetland preservation and mitigation efforts concentrate on sites lacking non-native fish for the conservation of native amphibians in the Willamette Valley and other western lowlands.},

	abstract = {Modes of colonization, the successional trajectory, and trophic recovery of a macrofaunal community were analyzed over 19 months in the Friendship marsh, a 20-acre restored wetland in Tijuana Estuary, California. Traditional techniques for quantifying macrofaunal communities were combined with emerging stable isotopic approaches for evaluation of trophic recovery, making comparisons with a nearby natural Spartina foliosa habitat. Life history-based predictions successfully identified major colonization modes, although most taxa employed a variety of tactics for colonizing the restored marsh. The presence of S.foliosa did not seem to affect macrofaunal colonization or succession at the scale of this study. However, soil organic matter content in the restored marsh was positively correlated with insect densities, and high initial salinities may have limited the success of early colonists. Total macrofaunal densities recovered to natural marsh levels after 14 months and diversity, measured as species richness and the Shannon index (H'), was comparable to the natural marsh by 19 months. Some compositional disparities between the natural and created communities persisted after 19 months, including lower percentages of surface-feeding polychaetes (Polydora spp.) and higher percentages of dipteran insects and turbellarians in the Friendship marsh. As surficial structural similarity of infaunal communities between the Friendship and natural habitat was achieved, isotopic analyses revealed a simultaneous trajectory towards recovery of trophic structure. Enriched delta(13)C signatures of benthic microalgae and infauna, observed in the restored marsh shortly after establishment compared to natural Spartina habitat, recovered after 19 months. However, the depletion in delta(15)N signatures of macrofauna in the Friendship marsh indicated consumption of microalgae, particularly nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, while macroalgae and Spartina made a larger contribution to macrofaunal diets in the natural habitat. Future successional studies must continue to develop and employ novel combinations of techniques for evaluating structural and functional recovery of disturbed and created habitats.

Wetlands were restored by means of dredging accumulated sediment and organic debris to create open water and emulate pre-disturbance conditions. Three call surveys were conducted in the spring and summer of 1998 and 1999 to estimate abundance and occurrence of spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer). wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). American toads (Bufo americanus), and green frogs (Rana clamitans) on restored and reference wetlands. Numbers of species calling and abundance indices of northern leopard frogs. green frogs, and spring peepers were significantly higher on restored versus reference wetlands. The number of species calling in restored wetlands was positively correlated with proximity to freshwater rivers;, in reference wetlands. the number was positively associated with forested perimeters and area of open water. Occurrence of calling green frogs in restored wetlands was positively correlated with percent cattail and. in reference wetlands, with proximity to other wetlands. Our results suggest that small wetland restoration projects may be a good conservation tool for anurans. We recommend further research on reproductive success and on local population trends in restored wetlands to determine if restoration is beneficial for anurans on PEI.},

	abstract = {Most restoration projects have focused on recovery of vegetation to assess restoration success. Nevertheless if the goal of a restoration project is to create an ecosystem that is self-supporting and resilient to perturbation, we also need information on the recovery of other trophic levels and ecosystem processes. To provide an example on how to assess restoration success, we compared four measures of vegetation structure, four measures of species diversity, and six measures of ecosystem processes among pre-reforested, reforested, and reference sites. In addition, we described how Bray Curtis Ordination could be used to evaluate restoration success. Vegetation structure recovered rapidly due to the increase in vegetation height and the decrease in herbaceous cover. Other measures such as litter cover, number of litter layers, and DBH size class values are recovering at slower rates, but they also have increased vegetation heterogeneity in the reforested site. Species diversity recovered rapidly. The increase in vegetation structure changed the local conditions in the reforested site facilitating the colonization of woody seedlings, ants, reptiles, and amphibians. Ecosystem processes, particularly litter production and turnover, have enhanced the incorporation of nutrients and organic matter in the soil. By including vegetation structure, species diversity, and ecosystem processes measures we have better information to determine the success of a restoration project. Moreover, the Subjective Bray Curtis Ordination is a useful approach for evaluating different restoration techniques or identifying measures that are recovering slowly and would benefit from additional management.

This work deals on the structure and composition of the geocomplexes of this area. The use of structural-genetic and historical-evolutionary principles permitted the survey, classification and cartography of mangrove landscapes at a detailed scale. It was possible to differentiate 28 inferior units, six intermediate units and five of a superior order all at the scale of 1:25 000. The results suggested that the physical-geographical approach complex could be of great use for the inventory, characterization and cartography of mangroves at a detailed scale, providing information on the genetic type of the relief litological composition, periodicity of flooding of surface areas, vegetative cover and soils. This information is invaluable for the environmental planning and preservation of these ecosystems.},

We conducted monthly surveys during 1997 in four replicate plots of each habitat type using several different methods of collection. Communities of the two wetland habitats (bottomland wetlands and isolated upland wetlands) were clearly dissimilar from the three terrestrial communities (recent clearcut, pine plantation, and mixed pine-hardwood forest). Among the three terrestrial habitats, the total herpetofaunal communities were dissimilar (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.10), although neither faunal constituent group alone (amphibians and squamate reptiles) varied significantly with regard to habitat. Three survey techniques used in the terrestrial habitats were not equally effective in that they resulted in the collection of different subsets of the total herpetofauna. The drift fence technique revealed the presence of more species and individuals in every habitat and was the only one to detect species dissimilarity among habitats. Nonetheless, coverboards contributed to measures of abundance and revealed species not detected by other techniques. We suggest that a combination of census techniques be used when surveying and monitoring herpetofaunal communities in order to maximize the detection of species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We asked three questions: (1) Is production related to species diversity? (2) Can production-diversity relationships be used to distinguish between restored and reference wetlands with the purpose of assessing ecological integrity? (3) Are production-diversity relationships influenced by species composition? Eight undisturbed, unrestored wetlands were chosen as references to compare to eight wetlands restored after drainage. Diatoms were collected from artificial substrates that allowed communities to be transplanted from restored to reference wetlands and visa versa. Production was measured as total cell biovolume and diversity as species richness. Neither diversity nor production alone differed between restored and reference wetlands. However, production was negatively related to diversity at restored wetlands, whereas production at reference wetlands was not. Communities transplanted from reference to restored wetlands exhibited a production-diversity relationship like that observed among control samples in restored wetlands. Likewise, communities transplanted from restored to reference wetlands apparently lost any such relationship after they were relocated. Production was dependent on species composition. Furthermore, production of some species differed by restored and reference wetland type. The negative relationship observed between diversity and production was strongly influenced by Rhopalodia gibba and Epithemia species, suggesting that these species were superior competitors under the conditions found in some restored wetlands. We consider restored wetlands displaying the highest production:diversity ratio to be the most impaired sites, based on the extreme deviation from reference wetlands. We conclude that the relationships between diversity and production provided a rapid measure of restored wetland integrity with respect to baseline conditions observed in reference sites.},

	volume = {458},
	abstract = {The management of the utilisation of natural resources from wetland ecosystems is a multiobjective and complex task. The creation of innovative decision making tools for sustainable wetland resource utilisation is an important challenge for the future. This is particularly crucial in the light of (lie growing shortages for high quality freshwater and the vanishing habitat for a large number of wetland fauna and flora species. Because wetlands combine attributes of both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, wetlands are often at the crossroads of a number of disciplines with no specific discipline of its own. Therefore, management programmes require a multidisciplinary approach founded oil a systematic monitoring of key biological and physical parameters. A European Commission DG XII research project dedicated to the development of management tools for wetland resources in Latin America is being developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers from eight universities, located in four EU member states, Argentina and Brazil. The study sites that will be utilised for this analysis are two shallow lakes in Northeast Argentina within the large (13 000 km(2)) wetland 'Esteros del Ibera'. Continuous and periodic in-situ monitoring instrumentation has been installed in a long term monitoring programme of hydrological and meteorological factors, coupled with monthly biological and ecological data gathering. Potential future scenarios for wetland resource use are being discussed in a series of public meetings with key provincial and local actors (teachers, university professors, clergymen, local business persons and politicians). These meetings address both the small scale modifications of wetland use (water extraction for agriculture, tourism, controlled hunting) as well as regional projects related to the creation of large scale economic development (forestation, modification of nearby waterways for hydroelectric production and increased river transportation), Models are developed relating the chemical, physical, biological and ecological parameters monitored. These models will be dedicated to analysing the effects of development oil wetland functions and resource quality. An economic model will be created to evaluate potential modifications in wetland functions in the local and regional socio-economic context. Evaluation instruments are developed and tested which include; qualitative models using loop analysis, goal functions based on the aquatic trophic web and the overall energy flux in the lagoon, and a geographical information system utilising satellite images. The purpose of these instruments is to examine the overall impacts of development alternatives on resource quality and ecosystem integrity, as well as demonstrating key parameters that should be more closely monitored. The final package will include an evaluation of the potential impacts of the development scenarios proposed by the key actors, recommendations to reduce specific impacts through alternative technologies, together with a monitoring programme and analysis tools for improved decision making in wetland resource management.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ympev.2010.11.006},
	abstract = {The superfamily Colubroidea ({\textbackslash}textgreater 2500 species) includes the majority of snake species and is one of the most conspicuous and well-known radiations of terrestrial vertebrates. However, many aspects of the phylogeny of the group remain contentious, and dozens of genera have yet to be included in molecular phylogenetic analyses. We present a new, large-scale, likelihood-based phylogeny for the colubroids, including 761 species sampled for up to five genes: cytochrome b (93\% of 761 species sampled), ND4 (69\%), ND2 (28\%), c-mos (54\%), and RAG-1 (13\%), totaling up to 5814bp per species. We also compare likelihood bootstrapping and a recently proposed ultra-fast measure of branch support (Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like [SHL] approximate likelihood ratio), and find that the SHL test shows strong support for several clades that were weakly-supported by bootstrapping in this or previous analyses (e.g., Dipsadinae, Lamprophiidae). We find that SHL values are positively related to branch lengths, but show stronger support for shorter branches than bootstrapping. Despite extensive missing data for many taxa (mean=67\% per species), neither bootstrap nor SHL support values for terminal species are related to their incompleteness, and that most highly incomplete taxa are placed in the expected families from previous taxonomy, typically with very strong support. The phylogeny indicates that the Neotropical colubrine genus Scaphiodontophis represents an unexpectedly ancient lineage within Colubridae. We present a revised higher-level classification of Colubroidea, which includes a new subfamily for Scaphiodontophis (Scaphiodontophiinae). Our study provides the most comprehensive phylogeny of Colubroidea to date, and suggests that SHL values may provide a useful complement to bootstrapping for estimating support on likelihood-based trees.},

The objective of this study was to measure the effects of various environmental variables on virus persistence. Test samples of soil were placed in vials, and the soil was wetted with suspensions of virus in either distilled water, unchlorinated secondary sewage effluent, or mixtures of effluent and water. The viruses used were coxsackieviruses A9 and B3, echovirus 1, poliovirus 2, rotavirus SA11, and bacteriophages T2 and MS2. The rate of virus inactivation was evaluated statistically with regard to conditions under which the vials were incubated and to the soil characteristics. The factors that were found to influence virus survival were temperature, soil moisture content, presence of aerobic microorganisms, degree of virus adsorption to the soil, soil levels of resin-extractable phosphorus, exchangeable aluminium, and soil pH. Overall, temperature and virus adsorption to soil appeared to be the most important factors affecting virus survival.},

An estimated 65\% of the cases in these outbreaks are caused by enteric viruses. Little, however, is known about the persistence of viruses in groundwater. The purpose of this study was to determine whether measurable chemical and physical factors correlate with virus survival in groundwater. Groundwater samples were obtained from 11 sites throughout the United States. Water temperature was measured at the time of collection. Several physical and chemical characteristics, including pH, nitrates, turbidity, and hardness, were determined for each sample. Separate water samples were inoculated with each of three viruses (poliovirus 1, echovirus 1, and MS-2 coliphage) and incubated at the in situ groundwater temperature; selected samples were also incubated at other temperatures. Assays were performed at predetermined intervals over a 30-day period to determine the number of infective viruses remaining. Multiple regression analysis revealed that temperature was the only variable significantly correlated with the decay rates of all three viruses. No significant differences were found among the decay rates of the three viruses, an indication that MS-2 coliphage might be used as a model of animal virus survival in groundwater.},

	abstract = {RNA viruses exploit all known mechanisms of genetic variation to ensure their survival. Distinctive features of RNA virus replication include high mutation rates, high yields, and short replication times. As a consequence, RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, called viral quasispecies. Mutation rates at defined genomic sites are affected by the nucleotide sequence context on the template molecule as well as by environmental factors. In vitro hypermutation reactions offer a means to explore the functional sequence space of nucleic acids and proteins. The evolution of a viral quasispecies is extremely dependent on the population size of the virus that is involved in the infections. Repeated bottleneck events lead to average fitness losses, with viruses that harbor unusual, deleterious mutations. In contrast, large population passages result in rapid fitness gains, much larger than those so far scored for cellular organisms. Fitness gains in one environment often lead to fitness losses in an alternative environment. An important challenge in RNA virus evolution research is the assignment of phenotypic traits to specific mutations. Different constellations of mutations may be associated with a similar biological behavior. In addition, recent evidence suggests the existence of critical thresholds for the expression of phenotypic traits. Epidemiological as well as functional and structural studies suggest that RNA viruses can tolerate restricted types and numbers of mutations during any specific time point during their evolution. Viruses occupy only a tiny portion of their potential sequence space. Such limited tolerance to mutations may open new avenues for combating viral infections.},

Human cases of Nipah virus infection, apparently unassociated with infection in livestock, have been reported in Bangladesh since 2001. Species of fruit bats (genus Pteropus) have been identified as natural hosts of both agents. Anthropogenic changes (habitat loss, hunting) that have impacted the population dynamics of Pteropus species across much of their range are hypothesised to have facilitated emergence. Current strategies for the management of henipaviruses are directed at minimising contact with the natural hosts, monitoring identified intermediate hosts, improving biosecurity on farms, and better disease recognition and diagnosis. Investigation of the emergence and ecology of henipaviruses warrants a broad, cross-disciplinary ecosystem health approach that recognises the critical linkages between human activity, ecological change, and livestock and human health.},

The driving forces behind these outbreaks is poorly understood. Certainly, one key driver of the emergence of these viruses is the virus population dynamics within the rodent population. Two new mathematical models for hantavirus infection in rodents are formulated and studied. The new models include the dynamics of susceptible, exposed, infective, and recovered male and female rodents. The first model is a system of ordinary differential equations while the second model is a system of stochastic differential equations. These new models capture some of the realistic dynamics of the male/female rodent hantavirus interaction: higher seroprevalence in males and variability in seroprevalence levels.},

We take into account the rodent dynamic features and the replicative dynamics of the virus in animals, high in the acute phase of newly infected animals and low in the subsequent chronic phase. The model revealed that only vole populations with multi-annual fluctuations allow for simultaneously high numbers of infected rodents and high proportions of those rodents in the acute excretion phase during the culminating phase of population build-up. This leads to a brief peak in exceptionally high concentrations of virus in the environment, and thereby, to human exposure. Such a mechanism suggests that a slight ecological disturbance in animal-parasite systems could result in the emergence of human diseases. Thus, the potential risk for public health due to several zoonotic diseases may be greater than previously believed, based solely on the distribution of human cases.},

We inactivated feline calicivirus, a surrogate for the nonculturable norovirus, in cell culture medium and mineral water by heat and high hydrostatic pressure. Incubation at ambient pressure and 75 degrees C for 2 min as well as treatment at 450 MPa and 15 degrees C for 1 min inactivated more than 7 log10 PFU of calicivirus per ml in cell culture medium or mineral water. The heat and pressure time-inactivation curves obtained with the calicivirus showed tailing in the logarithmic scale. Modeling by nth-order kinetics of the virus inactivation was successful in predicting the inactivation of the infective virus particles. The developed model enables the prediction of the calicivirus reduction in response to pressures up to 500 MPa, temperatures ranging from 5 to 75 degrees C, and various treatment times. We suggest high pressure for processing of foods to reduce the health threat posed by noroviruses.},

This review considers the origins, benefits and approaches to predictive microbiology and critically considers limitations and potential solutions. It is suggested that the traditional delineation between kinetic and probabilistic models is artificial, and that the two approaches represent the opposite ends of a spectrum of modelling needs. It is concluded: that despite the complexity of many food systems predictive modelling can be successfully applied; that strategies based on predictive models can simplify problems and allow useful predictions and analyses to be made; that the full potential of the technique has not yet been realised; and that "predictive microbiology" may be seen as providing a rational framework for understanding the microbial ecology of food.},

Three of eight infected guinea-pigs developed clinical signs 7-9 days post-inoculation. Infected fruit bats developed a subclinical infection characterized by the transient presence of virus within selected viscera, episodic viral excretion and seroconversion. A range of histopathological changes was observed within the tissues of infected bats. Nipah virus was excreted in bat urine while neutralizing antibody was present in serum. This intermittent, low-level excretion of Nipah virus in the urine of bats may be sufficient to sustain the net reproductive value of the virus in a species where there is regular urine contamination of the fur, mutual grooming, and where urine droplets are a feature of the environment.},

	issn = {0168-1605},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11930951},
	abstract = {This paper evaluates the applicability of the Weibull model to describe thermal inactivation of microbial vegetative cells as an alternative for the classical Bigelow model of first-order kinetics; spores are excluded in this article because of the complications arising due to the activation of dormant spores. The Weibull model takes biological variation, with respect to thermal inactivation, into account and is basically a statistical model of distribution of inactivation times. The model used has two parameters, the scale parameter alpha (time) and the dimensionless shape parameter beta. The model conveniently accounts for the frequently observed nonlinearity of semilogarithmic survivor curves, and the classical first-order approach is a special case of the Weibull model. The shape parameter accounts for upward concavity of a survival curve (beta {\textbackslash}textless 1), a linear survival curve (beta = 1), and downward concavity (beta {\textbackslash}textgreater 1). Although the Weibull model is of an empirical nature, a link can be made with physiological effects. Beta {\textbackslash}textless 1 indicates that the remaining cells have the ability to adapt to the applied stress, whereas beta {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 indicates that the remaining cells become increasingly damaged. Fifty-five case studies taken from the literature were analyzed to study the temperature dependence of the two parameters. The logarithm of the scale parameter alpha depended linearly on temperature, analogous to the classical D value. However, the temperature dependence of the shape parameter beta was not so clear. In only seven cases, the shape parameter seemed to depend on temperature, in a linear way. In all other cases, no statistically significant (linear) relation with temperature could be found. In 39 cases, the shape parameter beta was larger than 1, and in 14 cases, smaller than 1. Only in two cases was the shape parameter beta = 1 over the temperature range studied, indicating that the classical first-order kinetics approach is the exception rather than the rule. The conclusion is that the Weibull model can be used to model nonlinear survival curves, and may be helpful to pinpoint relevant physiological effects caused by heating. Most importantly, process calculations show that large discrepancies can be found between the classical first-order approach and the Weibull model. This case study suggests that the Weibull model performs much better than the classical inactivation model and can be of much value in modelling thermal inactivation more realistically, and therefore, in improving food safety and quality.},

	abstract = {The energetics of a salt bridge formed between the side chains of aspartic acid 70 (Asp70) and histidine 31 (His31) of T4 lysozyme have been examined by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The pKa values of the residues in the native state are perturbed from their values in the unfolded protein such that His31 has a pKa value of 9.1 in the native state and 6.8 in the unfolded state at 10 degrees C in moderate salt. Similarly, the aspartate pKa is shifted to a value of about 0.5 in the native state from its value of 3.5-4.0 in the unfolded state. These shifts in pKa show that the salt bridge is stabilized 3-5 kcal/mol. This implies that the salt bridge stabilizes the native state by 3-5 kcal/mol as compared to the unfolded state. This is reflected in the thermodynamic stability of mutants of the protein in which Asp70, His31, or both are replaced by asparagine. These observations and consideration of the thermodynamic coupling of protonation state to folding of proteins suggest a mechanism of acid denaturation in which the unfolded state is progressively stabilized by protonation of its acid residues as pH is lowered below pH 4. The unfolded state is stabilized only if acidic groups in the folded state have lower pKa values than in the unfolded state. When the pH is sufficiently low, the acid groups of both the native and unfolded states are fully protonated, and the apparent unfolding equilibrium constant becomes pH independent. Similar arguments apply to base-induced unfolding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Irrespective of whether the isothermal semi-logarithmic survival curves of heat inactivated microbial cells or spores are linear or nonlinear, it is theoretically possible to numerically calculate their survival parameters from inactivation data obtained under non-isothermal conditions. A method to do the calculation, when the temperature history ('profile') is expressed algebraically, is demonstrated with simulated survival curves. It has been tested with the published survival data of Salmonella, whose nonlinear semi-logarithmic isothermal survival curves can be described by a power law model. The reported survival ratios of Salmonella, determined during non-isothermal heat treatments in a broth and in ground chicken breast, were used to estimate its isothermal survival parameters in the two media and their temperature dependence. These, in turn, were used to predict the cells' survival curves under different temperature 'profiles.' There was a good agreement between the predicted and the reported experimental survival curves in the broth case and reasonable agreement in the ground chicken breasts, where the database was considerably smaller The development of a mathematical method to calculate survival parameters from non-isothermal inactivation data will eliminate the need to determine these parameters under isothermal conditions, which can only be approximated and are technically difficult to perform. In many cases, the proposed method will also enable the determination of the survival parameters in the actual food or medium of interest, which may contain particles, or is too viscous to be heated and cooled effectively using the currently available experimental procedures. In principle, the described mathematical method can also be used to assess organisms' survival parameters in nonthermal inactivation processes, such as exposure to a dissipating chemical agent or the application of ultra high-pressure.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the seroepidemiology of Hendra virus in a spectacled flying-fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) population in northern Australia, near the location of an equine and associated human Hendra virus infection in late 2004. The pattern of infection in the population was investigated using a serial cross-sectional serological study over a 25-month period, with blood sampled from 521 individuals over six sampling sessions. Antibody titres to the virus were determined by virus neutralisation test. In contrast to the expected episodic infection pattern, we observed that seroprevalence gradually increased over the two years suggesting infection was endemic in the population over the study period. Our results suggested age, pregnancy and lactation were significant risk factors for a detectable neutralizing antibody response. Antibody titres were significantly higher in females than males, with the highest titres occurring in pregnant animals. Temporal variation in antibody titres suggests that herd immunity to the virus may wax and wane on a seasonal basis. These findings support an endemic infection pattern of henipaviruses in bat populations suggesting their infection dynamics may differ significantly from the acute, self limiting episodic pattern observed with related viruses (e.g. measles virus, phocine distemper virus, rinderpest virus) hence requiring a much smaller critical host population size to sustain the virus. These findings help inform predictive modelling of henipavirus infection in bat populations, and indicate that the life cycle of the reservoir species should be taken into account when developing risk management strategies for henipaviruses.},

Prevalence estimates of wildlife population surveys are often based on regional count data generated by sampling animals shot by hunters. The observed disease rate per spatial unit is not an useful estimate of the underlying disease prevalence due to different sample sizes and spatial dependencies between neighbouring areas. Therefore, it is necessary to account for extra-sample variation and spatial correlations in the data to produce more accurate maps of disease incidence. The detection of spatial patterns is complicated by missing data in many of the geographical areas as the complete coverage of all areas is nearly impossible in wildlife surveys. For this purpose a hierarchical Bayesian model in which structured and unstructured over dispersion is modelled explicitly in terms of spatial and non-spatial components was implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The model was empirically compared with the results of a non-spatial beta-binomial model using surveillance data of pseudorabies virus infections of European wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa L.) in the Federal State of Brandenburg, Germany.},

	abstract = {Survival of airborne virus influences the extent of disease transmission via air. How environmental factors affect viral survival is not fully understood. We investigated the survival of a vaccine strain of Gumboro virus which was aerosolized at three temperatures (10°C, 20°C, and 30°C) and two relative humidities (RHs) (40\% and 70\%). The response of viral survival to four metrics (temperature, RH, absolute humidity [AH], and evaporation potential [EP]) was examined. The results show a biphasic viral survival at 10°C and 20°C, i.e., a rapid initial inactivation in a short period (2.3 min) during and after aerosolization, followed by a slow secondary inactivation during a 20-min period after aerosolization. The initial decays of aerosolized virus at 10°C (1.68 to 3.03 ln \% min(-1)) and 20°C (3.05 to 3.62 ln \% min(-1)) were significantly lower than those at 30°C (5.67 to 5.96 ln \% min(-1)). The secondary decays at 10°C (0.03 to 0.09 ln \% min(-1)) tended to be higher than those at 20°C (-0.01 to 0.01 ln \% min(-1)). The initial viral survival responded to temperature and RH and potentially to EP; the secondary viral survival responded to temperature and potentially to RH. In both phases, survival of the virus was not significantly affected by AH. These findings suggest that long-distance transmission of airborne virus is more likely to occur at 20°C than at 10°C or 30°C and that current Gumboro vaccination by wet aerosolization in poultry industry is not very effective due to the fast initial decay.},

	abstract = {Spatial epidemiology is the study of spatial variation in disease risk or incidence. Several ecological processes can result in strong spatial patterns of such risk or incidence: for example, pathogen dispersal might be highly localized, vectors or reservoirs for pathogens might be spatially restricted, or susceptible hosts might be clumped. Here, we briefly describe approaches to spatial epidemiology that are spatially implicit, such as metapopulation models of disease transmission, and then focus on research in spatial epidemiology that is spatially explicit, such as the creation of risk maps for particular geographical areas. Although the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases are the subject of intensive study, the impacts of landscape structure on epidemiological processes have so far been neglected. The few studies that demonstrate how landscape composition (types of elements) and configuration (spatial positions of those elements) influence disease risk or incidence suggest that a true integration of landscape ecology with epidemiology will be fruitful.},

In this paper, we use an existing collection of 1,220,000 simulated benchmark data, generated under 51 different clustering models, to compare the statistical power of several disease clustering tests. These tests are Besag-Newell's R, Cuzick-Edwards' k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), the spatial scan statistic, Tango's Maximized Excess Events Test (MEET), Swartz' entropy test, Whittemore's test, Moran's I and a modification of Moran's I. RESULTS: Except for Moran's I and Whittemore's test, all other tests have good power for detecting some kind of clustering. The spatial scan statistic is good at detecting localized clusters. Tango's MEET is good at detecting global clustering. With appropriate choice of parameter, Besag-Newell's R and Cuzick-Edwards' k-NN also perform well. CONCLUSION: The power varies greatly for different test statistics and alternative clustering models. Consideration of the power is important before we decide which test statistic to use.},

We used spatial and temporal analytical techniques to describe the epidemic, to quantify important descriptors of the epidemic, and to generate hypotheses about how the epidemic progressed and which control tools assisted in eradication. Spatio-temporal epidemic curves revealed three phases in the epidemic: dispersal, local spread and disease fade out. Spatial dispersal of infection rapidly declined immediately after national movement restrictions were introduced. The epidemic peak had passed before emergency vaccination could have induced substantial immunity in the equine population. Thirty seven clusters of epidemiologically linked premises were delineated using an interpolated surface of date of onset of clinical signs, geographic data and location of infected premises. These clusters were analysed individually to parameterise key epidemic measures: cumulative incidence, incidence rate, effective reproduction rate, nearest neighbour spread distances, epidemic length and the number of infected premises. These measures were summarised by landscape (rural versus peri-urban location) and standardised by disease management zone. Compared to rural areas, peri-urban areas appeared to have a higher density of equine premises (4.66 premises km(-2) versus 0.80 premises km(-2)), longer epidemics (95 days versus 87 days), more infected premises (393 versus 339) and a shorter spread distance (1.27 km versus 2.38 km). However, effective reproduction rates (2.04 versus 1.99), cumulative incidence (27.4 versus 26.9) and incidence rates (1.36 versus 1.54) were similar. The relative impact of vaccination and national movement restrictions in controlling this epidemic needs further investigation.},

	abstract = {Outbreaks of acute respiratory disease occurred in several cattle herds in the south-east regions of Norway during the winter and spring of 1995. The present study was conducted to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the occurrence of acute respiratory disease between January and April 1995 in the affected cattle herds, in two neighbouring counties in Norway. This was done to assess the possible role of an infectious agent in these outbreaks, as well as to investigate the possibility of transmission between neighbouring herds. During the study period, a total of 190 (19.8\%) outbreaks occurred in 955 cattle herds located in the defined study area. Descriptive maps of the spatial and spatio-temporal patterns of the outbreak were generated, and two different statistical tests of space-time interaction (the Knox test and k-nearest neighbour test) and a cluster-detection test (the space-time scan statistic) were used. The results of all the space-time interaction tests strongly suggested that the case herds were clustered in time as well as in space. In addition, the space-time scan statistic defined the most-likely cluster to be located within the second veterinary district (Toten where the disease occurred) during 9-15 weeks in 1995. The relative risk of a herd being infected inside the most-likely cluster compared with the surrounding study area was estimated to be 3.59 (p=0.001). The transmission rate between neighbouring farms therefore appeared to have been higher within this cluster than in the surrounding study area. This study supports the hypothesis that one common source of infection was involved in the outbreaks during the study period.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this paper to analyse, model and simulate the spread of an infectious disease by resorting to modern stochastic algorithms. The approach renders it possible to circumvent the simplifying assumption of linearity imposed in the majority of the past works on stochastic analysis of epidemic processes. Infectious diseases are often transmitted through contacts of those infected with those susceptible; hence the processes are inherently nonlinear. According to the classical model of Kermack and McKendrick, or the SIR model, three classes of populations are involved in two types of processes: conversion of susceptibles (S) to infectives (I) and conversion of infectives to removed (R). The master equations of the SIR process have been formulated through the probabilistic population balance around a particular state by considering the mutually exclusive events. The efficacy of the present methodology is mainly attributable to its ability to derive the governing equations for the means, variances and covariance of the random variables by the method of system-size expansion of the nonlinear master equations. Solving these equations simultaneously along with rates associated influenza epidemic data yields information concerning not only the means of the three populations but also the minimal uncertainties of these populations inherent in the epidemic. The stochastic pathways of the three different classes of populations during an epidemic, i.e. their means and the fluctuations around these means, have also been numerically simulated independently by the algorithm derived from the master equations, as well as by an event-driven Monte Carlo algorithm. The master equation and Monte Carlo algorithms have given rise to the identical results.},

Simple formulations often work best for systems with a small number of reactions, while some sophisticated methods offer the best performance for large problems and scale well asymptotically. We investigate the performance of each formulation on simple biological systems using a wide range of problem sizes. We also consider the numerical accuracy of the direct and the next reaction method.

	abstract = {Objectives: The relative importance of airborne, droplet and contact transmission of influenza A virus and the efficiency of control measures depends among other factors on the inactivation of viruses in different environmental media. Methods: We systematically review available information on the environmental inactivation of influenza A viruses and employ information on infectious dose and results from mathematical models to assess transmission modes. Results: Daily inactivation rate constants differ by several orders of magnitude: on inanimate surfaces and in aerosols daily inactivation rates are in the order of 1-102, on hands in the order of 103. Influenza virus can survive in aerosols for several hours, on hands for a few minutes. Nasal infectious dose of influenza A is several orders of magnitude larger than airborne infectious dose. Conclusions: The airborne route is a potentially important transmission pathway for influenza in indoor environments. The importance of droplet transmission has to be reassessed. Contact transmission can be limited by fast inactivation of influenza virus on hands and is more so than airborne transmission dependent on behavioral parameters. However, the potentially large inocula deposited in the environment through sneezing and the protective effect of nasal mucus on virus survival could make contact transmission a key transmission mode. © 2008 The British Infection Society.},

Automated data collection systems enable near-real time analysis of incoming data. This context places a heavy burden on software used for space-time surveillance. In this paper, we review software programs capable of space-time disease surveillance analysis, and outline some of their salient features, shortcomings, and usability. Programs with space-time methods were selected for inclusion, limiting our review to ClusterSeer, SaTScan, GeoSurveillance and the Surveillance package for R. We structure the review around stages of analysis: preprocessing, analysis, technical issues, and output. Simulated data were used to review each of the software packages. SaTScan was found to be the best equipped package for use in an automated surveillance system. ClusterSeer is more suited to data exploration, and learning about the different methods of statistical surveillance.},

This study sought to (1) compare several sampling methods during the establishment of a monitoring program and (2) describe differences in species composition among the study sites. We investigated whether observed differences among sites depended on sampling method. The study was performed at the Jatun Sacha Biological Station in the Upper Amazon Basin in Ecuador. We established seven sites in primary forest and sampled amphibians four times over a 5-mo period using transects searched during the day and night, artificial cover stations, and artificial ponds. Significantly more species were found during nocturnal searches of transects than with the other methods. In cluster analysis of species occurrences, both diurnal and nocturnal transect searches identified one floodplain site as being distinct from the rest. Sites appear most similar when artificial ponds were considered and consistently less similar in data from nocturnally searched transects. Data from both types of transect and from artificial cover indicated that one site in the reserve's interior was particularly rich in species of Eleutherodactylus. Additionally, nocturnal transects detected increased species richness of hylid frogs at the two floodplain sites. This is consistent with the aquatic mode of reproduction of hylid frogs. Higher species richness of Eleutherodactylus is characteristic of drier terra firme forest with low disturbance. These trends are most dear in data from nocturnally searched transects.},

The herpetofaunal response to restoration was examined in fire-suppressed, hardwood-dominated areas treated with (1) spring fire, (2) felling or girdling; or (3) a granular form of the herbicide hexazinone. No-treatment controls were also included. Felling or girdling and herbicide plots were burned for fuel reduction two dormant seasons after initial treatment application. Additionally, data were collected in frequently burned reference sandhills to establish the target condition or restoration goal. Vegetation variables and herpetofaunal capture rates were compared among control and treatment areas. Two similarity indices were utilized to compare treatments and controls with reference sites, to examine restoration success. Restoration treatment effects were observed through reduced hardwood densities. Litter composition varied among control and treatment plots, with leaf litter being highest in areas lacking recent fire. Capture rates of some herpetofaunal species varied significantly among treatment plots. In 1997 similarity indices showed that spring-burned and felling or girdling plots were more similar to the reference sandhills than the other plots. Treated plots were not significantly different from controls in 1998, a year of a severe drought.},

	abstract = {Recognition of individual animals is essential for a wide variety of research and monitoring studies involving amphibians, but little information exists on the effects that marking methods have on survivorship, life history, and behavior. We evaluated toe clipping and subcutaneous injections of a fluorescent-elastomer for individual identification of the western red-backed salamander, Plethodon vehiculum, on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. In the laboratory, no confirmed mortality of marked or unmarked (control) salamanders occurred over 64 weeks. The number of toe clips lost as the result of regeneration increased steadily after 35 weeks postmarking, but few fluorescent marks were lost or misidentified. In the field, we recaptured more fluorescent-marked (60\%) than toe-clipped (40\%) salamanders from September 1997 to May 1998 but detected no differences in growth or spatial movements. In a second field experiment (27 April to 31 May 1999), toe-clipped salamanders gained less weight in relation to their initial body size than did fluorescent-marked and control salamanders. These data suggest that toe clipping affects the ability of individuals to take full advantage of optimal foraging conditions that prevail in May, which, in turn, might affect the quantity of stored energy reserves required for survival over adverse, dry periods in summer.},

	abstract = {Adaptive management is a key component of a forest project being implemented across all of Weyerhaeuser's coastal forest tenures. This project uses two main tools to accomplish the British Columbia (BC) Coastal Group's ecological and socio-economic goals: variable retention (VR) harvesting and broad zoning of the land base. The adaptive management program was designed to examine the effectiveness of retention systems and zoning in maintaining those forest attributes necessary to sustain biological richness and essential ecosystem functions, such as nutrient transfer, energy flow, decomposition, and dispersal of seeds, spores, and animals. The program is grounded on three biological indicators evaluated in both operational and experimental contexts: 1) representation of habitat types in a relatively unmanaged state to ensure that little-known species are retained; 2) structure of stands and landscapes to ensure that key elements are present through time; and 3) indicator organisms to track whether retaining structures and patterns, while addressing representation, will maintain species and populations whose life needs are well understood. Representation of ecosystems in unmanaged conditions has been examined. Habitat structure is being assessed in VR blocks and in unmanaged blocks. Studies on several organisms (breeding birds, owls, gastropods, amphibians, bryophytes, lichen, squirrels, mycorrhizae, and carabid beetles) have been underway for various lengths of time. These studies collected baseline information to begin comparisons of the effectiveness of the various types of VR for maintaining biological richness. The current focus in the adaptive management program is refining the lists of specific elements to monitor and beginning to create tools to help extrapolate relationships and findings over large areas and long time frames, with the expectation of operational implementation in 2003. The first two years of pilot work are also being used to examine how the results will link to management practices to strengthen areas that most need improvement. This paper describes three indicators used in Weyerhaeuser's adaptive management program.},

In 2001-2002 we resurveyed a hitherto unexamined baseline of monitoring data established in 1973-1980 at some 300 sites in western, central, and northern New York State, USA, and contrasted population transitions with environmental conditions to identify correlates of population change in American toads (Bufo americanus), northern spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), western chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata), leopard frogs (Rana pipiens), and wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). At the regional level, loss of habitats along roadsides has been substantial (minimally 7-12\% of sites), yet within remaining wetlands, populations of most anurans have not declined. At the local level, population disappearance was associated with elevated levels of acid deposition (in American toad, spring peeper, western chorus frog, and leopard frog), urban development (American toad and spring peeper), increased forest cover (western chorus frog), and high-intensity agriculture (spring peeper); whereas population persistence was associated with increased deciduous forest cover (American toad, spring peeper, and wood frog) and low-intensity agriculture (American toad and western chorus frog). Habitat configurations at surprisingly large spatial scales (5-10 km from surveyed populations) were most closely associated with transitions in local anuran populations, implying that large-scale extinction-recolonization dynamics influence population transitions, a result land managers should consider in conservation planning.},

We studied the effect of wetlands ecosystem restoration on amphibian population recovery at Kankakee Sands in northwest Indiana, USA. We also tested predictions about colonization in relation to proximity to existing nature preserves and species characteristics. Prior to restoration activities (1998), the amphibian community at Kankakee Sands consisted of fourteen populations of seven species at seven breeding sites. By 2001, this community increased to 60 populations at 26 sites; however, species richness had not increased. By 2002 the community increased to 143 populations of eight species at 38 sites, and by 2003 there were 172 populations of ten species at 44 sites. Abundance index values increased 15-fold from 1998-2003. These increases best fit the exponential growth model. Although survival through metamorphosis was substantial during wetter than average years (2002 and 2003), during other years restored wetlands dried before larvae of most species transformed. Amphibian colonization was greatest near a nature preserve with the greatest amphibian diversity. The earliest colonists included fossorial species and those species whose habitat includes wet and mesic sand prairie. However, the fossorial Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) was the last species to colonize Kankakee Sands.},

	abstract = {Amphibian populations are declining at an alarming pace in many parts of the world. Consequently, as part of the strategy for establishing a 360 km(2) conservation and reference area for amphibians in central Norway, 341 lentic water bodies were surveyed to investigate and briefly describe their hydrography and the occurrence of the newts Triturus vulgaris (L.) and T. cristatus (Laurenti) in the area. In particular we investigated the factors that could explain the presence of the respective newt species, including biotic and abiotic factors. The multiple logistic regression analyses suggested that the presence of T cristatus was best explained by altitude and ion concentration, both in a nonlinear fashion, whereas fish had a negative effect on T cristatus, which was never found coexisting with fish. The presence of T vulgaris was best explained by altitude (linear relationship) and ion concentration (convex relationship), besides the occurrence of T cristatus. Triturus vulgaris was occasionally found to occur at low densities in ponds having fish. For both species the probability of presence was higher when the opposite newt species was present. pH influenced both species in a convex nonlinear fashion with highest probability of presence around pH 6.5. This area is valuable for conservation, monitoring and reference for marginal amphibian populations. Any decline in their abundance would be discovered relatively quickly, and likely causes could be inferred. It can also serve as a reference area for future comparative studies of amphibians elsewhere.},

However, while these reproductive patterns have been well documented for temperate salamanders, detailed data for tropical species are relatively sparse. I used histological techniques to examine temporal variation in the spermatogenetic cycles of four species of Guatemalan bolitoglossine salamanders (Bolitoglossa occidentalis, B. rostrata, Dendrotriton bromeliacia and Pseudoeurycea goebeli) from different microhabitats along an elevational gradient. All four species have mature sperm present in the testis throughout the year, irrespective of patterns of courtship and egg-laying. Additionally, the two species from more seasonal habitats (B. occidentalis and B. rostrata) exhibit significant but cryptic levels of variation in the amount of spermatozoa present in the testis not detectable by external appearance or the presence of secondary sexual characteristics. For the two species from less seasonal cloud forests (D. bromeliacia and R goebeli), there were no detectable patterns to variation within the testis. Regional variation in climate undoubtedly influences reproductive cycles, however, microhabitat and the immediate environment are also important determinants of reproductive strategy.

	volume = {597},
	abstract = {A new pond complex, designed to enhance aquatic biodiversity, was monitored over a 7-year period. The Pinkhill Meadow site, located in grassland adjacent to the R. Thames, proved unusually rich in terms of its macrophyte, aquatic macroinvertebrate and wetland bird assemblages. In total, the 3.2 ha mosaic of ca. 40 permanent, semi-permanent and seasonal ponds and pools was colonized by approximately 20\% of all UK wetland plant and macroinvertebrate species over the 7-year survey period. This included eight invertebrate species that are Nationally Scarce in the UK. The site supported three breeding species of wading bird and was used by an additional 54 species of waders, waterfowl and other wetland birds. The results from four monitoring ponds investigated in more detail showed that these ponds significantly supported more plant and macroinvertebrate species than both minimally impaired UK reference ponds, and other new ponds for which compatible data were available. Comparisons of the physico-chemical, hydrological and land-use characteristics of the Pinkhill pools with those of other new ponds showed that the site was unusual in having a high proportion of wetlands in the near surrounds. It also had significantly lower water conductivity than other ponds and a higher proportion of (non-woodland) semi-natural land in its surroundings. Given that ponds are known to contribute significantly to UK biodiversity at a landscape level, and that several thousand new ponds are created each year in the UK alone, the findings suggest that well designed and located pond complexes could be used to significantly enhance freshwater biodiversity within catchments.},

Relationships among the haplotypes obtained were recovered using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Most of the clades recovered by both tree building methods are strongly supported, but conflicting clades recovered by each analysis are generally poorly supported. Both analyses reject the previously proposed subgroupings of the R. berlandieri species group. Based on the strongly supported relationships, genetic differentiation, and geographic distribution of the haplotypes examined, nine independent lineages appear to comprise the group of study. However, confirmation of the new proposed lineages will require further analyses based on other genetic markers and additional samples that cover their entire geographic distribution. Concordance was noted between Miocene-Pliocene geological and climatic events in Mexico and the relationships recovered among the lineages proposed and their geographic distribution.

	abstract = {Since it was first described in Australia in 1994, Hendra virus (HeV) has caused two outbreaks of fatal disease in horses and humans, and an isolated fatal horse case. Our preliminary studies revealed a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to HeV in bats of the genus PTEROPUS:, but it was unclear whether this was due to infection with HeV or a related virus. We developed the hypothesis that HeV excretion from bats might be related to the birthing process and we targeted the reproductive tract for virus isolation. Three virus isolates were obtained from the uterine fluid and a pool of foetal lung and liver from one grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus), and from the foetal lung of one black flying-fox (P. alecto). Antigenically, these isolates appeared to be closely related to HeV, returning positive results on immunofluorescent antibody staining and constant-serum varying-virus neutralization tests. Using an HeV-specific oligonucleotide primer pair, genomic sequences of the isolates were amplified. Sequencing of 200 nucleotides in the matrix gene identified that these three isolates were identical to HeV. Isolations were confirmed after RNA extracted from original material was positive for HeV RNA when screened on an HeV Taqman assay. The isolation of HeV from pteropid bats corroborates our earlier serological and epidemiological evidence that they are a natural reservoir host of the virus.},

Phylogenetic reconstruction of host associations suggests a predominance of host switches from bats to other mammals and birds. Hypothesis tests in a maximum likelihood framework permit the phylogenetic placement of bats as tentative hosts at ancestral nodes to both the major Paramyxoviridae subfamilies (Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae).

Murray et al., Science 268:94-97, 1995). To facilitate characterization and classification, the virus was purified, viral proteins were identified, and the P/V/C gene was cloned and sequenced. The coding strategy of the gene is similar to that of Sendai and measles viruses, members of the Paramyxovirus and Morbillivirus genera, respectively, in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae. The P/V/C gene contains four open reading frames, three of which, P, C, and V, have Paramyxovirinae counterparts. The P and C proteins are larger and smaller, respectively, than are cognate proteins in members of the subfamily, and the V protein is made as a result of a single G insertion during transcription. The P/V/C gene has two unique features. (i) A fourth open reading frame is located between those of the C and V proteins and potentially encodes a small basic protein similar to those found in some members of the Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae families. (ii) There is also a long untranslated 3' sequence, a feature common in Filoviridae members. Sequence comparisons confirm that although the virus is a member of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily, it displays only low levels of homology with paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses and negligible homologies with rubulaviruses.},

This work has provided much insight on the role that heterogeneity in host contact patterns plays on infectious disease dynamics. Despite the important understanding afforded by the probability and simulation paradigm, this approach does not directly address important questions about the structure of contact networks such as what is the best network model for a particular mode of disease transmission, how parameter values of a given model should be estimated, or how precisely the data allow us to estimate these parameter values. We argue that these questions are best answered within a statistical framework and discuss the role of statistical inference in estimating contact networks from epidemiological data.},

We then show how the same theory can be used to analyze stochastic SIR models with random and proportionate mixing. The epidemic percolation networks for these models are purely directed because undirected edges disappear in the limit of a large population. In a series of simulations, we show that epidemic percolation networks accurately predict the mean outbreak size and probability and final size of an epidemic for a variety of epidemic models in homogeneous and heterogeneous populations. Finally, we show that epidemic percolation networks can be used to re-derive classical results from several different areas of infectious disease epidemiology. In an Appendix, we show that an epidemic percolation network can be defined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model in a closed population and prove that the distribution of outbreak sizes given the infection of any given node in the SIR model is identical to the distribution of its out-component sizes in the corresponding probability space of epidemic percolation networks. We conclude that the theory of percolation on semi-directed networks provides a very general framework for the analysis of stochastic SIR models in closed populations.},

	abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a 'mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

In a series of experiments, Pteropus bats from Malaysia and Australia were inoculated with NiV and HeV, respectively, by natural routes of infection. Despite an intensive sampling strategy, no NiV was recovered from the Malaysian bats and HeV was reisolated from only one Australian bat; no disease was seen. These experiments suggest that opportunities for henipavirus transmission may be limited; therefore, the probability of a spillover event is low. For spillover to occur, a range of conditions and events must coincide. An alternate assessment framework is required if we are to fully understand how this reservoir host maintains and transmits not only these but all viruses with which it has been associated.},

The aim of the experiments reported here was to investigate transplacental infection as a possible mode of transmission of the virus in fruit bats and other animals. In a first experiment, 18 pregnant guinea-pigs in the mid-stage of gestation were inoculated with HeV, as an experimental model in a conventional laboratory animal. Nine developed HeV disease as confirmed by viral isolation, histopathology and immunohistochemistry. In five of the nine clinically affected guinea-pigs there was necrosis and strong positive immunostaining in the placentas in an indirect immunoperoxidase (IPX) test for HeV antigen. One of these five guinea-pigs aborted and HeV was isolated from its three fetuses, one of which was also positive to the IPX test. In three other sick guinea-pig dams, virus was isolated from fetuses, and there was positive immunostaining in two of the latter. In a second experiment, four fruit bats were inoculated with a similar dose of HeV. (A further four guinea-pigs inoculated at the same time developed severe disease, indicating adequate virulence.) Two bats were killed at 10 days post-inoculation and two were killed at 21 days. In these bats, no overt clinical disease was observed, but subclinical disease occurred, as indicated by viral isolation, seroconversion, vascular lesions and positive immunostaining. Transplacental transmission was indicated by positive immunostaining in two placentas and confirmed by isolation of virus from one of the associated fetuses.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) is a lethal paramyxovirus which emerged in humans in 1994. Poor understanding of HeV dynamics in Pteropus spp. (flying fox or fruit bat) reservoir hosts has limited our ability to determine factors driving its emergence. We initiated a longitudinal field study of HeV in little red flying foxes (LRFF; Pteropus scapulatus) and examined individual and population risk factors for infection, to determine probable modes of intraspecific transmission. We also investigated whether seasonal changes in host behaviour, physiology and demography affect host-pathogen dynamics. Data showed that pregnant and lactating females had significantly higher risk of infection, which may explain previously observed temporal associations between HeV outbreaks and flying fox birthing periods. Age-specific seroprevalence curves generated from field data imply that HeV is transmitted horizontally via faeces, urine or saliva. Rapidly declining seroprevalence between two field seasons suggests that immunity wanes faster in LRFF than in other flying fox species, and highlights the potentially critical role of this species in interspecific viral persistence. The highest seroprevalence was observed when animals showed evidence of nutritional stress, suggesting that environmental processes that alter flying fox food sources, such as habitat loss and climate change, may increase HeV infection and transmission. These insights into the ecology of HeV in flying fox populations suggest causal links between anthropogenic environmental change and HeV emergence.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) causes a zoonotic disease with high mortality that is transmitted to humans from bats of the genus Pteropus (flying foxes) via an intermediary equine host. Factors promoting spillover from bats to horses are uncertain at this time, but plausibly encompass host and/or agent and/or environmental factors. There is a lack of HeV sequence information derived from the natural bat host, as previously sequences have only been obtained from horses or humans following spillover events. In order to obtain an insight into possible variants of HeV circulating in flying foxes, collection of urine was undertaken in multiple flying fox roosts in Queensland, Australia. HeV was found to be geographically widespread in flying foxes with a number of HeV variants circulating at the one time at multiple locations, while at times the same variant was found circulating at disparate locations. Sequence diversity within variants allowed differentiation on the basis of nucleotide changes, and hypervariable regions in the genome were identified that could be used to differentiate circulating variants. Further, during the study, HeV was isolated from the urine of flying foxes on four occasions from three different locations. The data indicates that spillover events do not correlate with particular HeV isolates, suggesting that host and/or environmental factors are the primary determinants of bat-horse spillover. Thus future spillover events are likely to occur, and there is an on-going need for effective risk management strategies for both human and animal health.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus is a recently emerged bat-borne zoonotic agent with high lethality in horses and humans in Australia. This is a rare disease and the determinants of bat to horse transmission, including the factors that bring these hosts together at critical times, are poorly understood. In this cross-disciplinary study climatic and vegetation primary productivity variables are compared for the dispersed and heterogenic 1994-2010 outbreak sites. The significant occurrence of spillover events within the dry season (p = 0.013, 95\% CI (0.57-0.98)) suggests seasonal forcing of transmission across species, or seasonal forcing of virus excretion by the reservoir host. We explore the evidence for both. Preliminary investigations of the spatial determinants of Hendra disease locations are also presented. We find that postal areas in the Australian state of Queensland in which pteropid fruit bat (flying fox) roosts occur are approximately forty times more likely (OR = 40.5, (95\% CI (5.16, 317.52)) to be the location of Hendra spillover events. This appears to be independent of density of horses at these locations. We consider issues of scale of host resource use, land use change and limitations of existing data that challenge analysis and limit further conclusive outcomes. This investigation of a broad range of potential climatic and environmental influences provides a good base for future investigations. Further understanding of cross-species Hendra virus transmission requires better understanding of flying fox resource use in the urban-rural landscape.},

	abstract = {Hendra virus is a recently emerged zoonotic agent in Australia. Since first described in 1994, the virus has spilled from its wildlife reservoir (pteropid fruit bats, or 'flying foxes') on multiple occasions causing equine and human fatalities. We undertook a three-year longitudinal study to detect virus in the urine of free-living flying foxes (a putative route of excretion) to investigate Hendra virus infection dynamics. Pooled urine samples collected off plastic sheets placed beneath roosting flying foxes were screened for Hendra virus genome by quantitative RT-PCR, using a set of primers and probe derived from the matrix protein gene. A total of 1672 pooled urine samples from 67 sampling events was collected and tested between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2011, with 25\% of sampling events and 2.5\% of urine samples yielding detections. The proportion of positive samples was statistically associated with year and location. The findings indicate that Hendra virus excretion occurs periodically rather than continuously, and in geographically disparate flying fox populations in the state of Queensland. The lack of any detection in the Northern Territory suggests prevalence may vary across the range of flying foxes in Australia. Finally, our findings suggest that flying foxes can excrete virus at any time of year, and that the apparent seasonal clustering of Hendra virus incidents in horses and associated humans (70\% have occurred June to October) reflects factors other than the presence of virus. Identification of these factors will strengthen risk minimization strategies for horses and ultimately humans.},

Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats.

The basic reproduction number is computed and shown to increase with n, the number of hosts that can be infected. Therefore, the possibility of disease emergence increases with the number of hosts infected. The SIS model for two hosts is studied in detail. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the global stability of an endemic equilibrium. Numerical examples illustrate the dynamics of the two- and three-host epidemic models.

Each virus also causes serious and commonly lethal infection of people as well as various species of domestic animals, however little is known about the associated mechanisms of pathogenesis. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new paramyxovirus from pteropid bats, Cedar virus (CedPV), which shares significant features with the known henipaviruses. The genome size (18,162 nt) and organization of CedPV is very similar to that of HeV and NiV; its nucleocapsid protein displays antigenic cross-reactivity with henipaviruses; and it uses the same receptor molecule (ephrin-B2) for entry during infection. Preliminary challenge studies with CedPV in ferrets and guinea pigs, both susceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses, confirmed virus replication and production of neutralizing antibodies although clinical disease was not observed. In this context, it is interesting to note that the major genetic difference between CedPV and HeV or NiV lies within the coding strategy of the P gene, which is known to play an important role in evading the host innate immune system. Unlike HeV, NiV, and almost all known paramyxoviruses, the CedPV P gene lacks both RNA editing and also the coding capacity for the highly conserved V protein. Preliminary study indicated that CedPV infection of human cells induces a more robust IFN-β response than HeV.},

	abstract = {Serengeti lions frequently experience viral outbreaks. In 1994, one-third of Serengeti lions died from canine distemper virus (CDV). Based on the limited epidemiological data available from this period, it has been unclear whether the 1994 outbreak was propagated by lion-to-lion transmission alone or involved multiple introductions from other sympatric carnivore species. More broadly, we do not know whether contacts between lions allow any pathogen with a relatively short infectious period to percolate through the population (i.e. reach epidemic proportions). We built one of the most realistic contact network models for a wildlife population to date, based on detailed behavioural and movement data from a long-term lion study population. The model allowed us to identify previously unrecognized biases in the sparse data from the 1994 outbreak and develop methods for judiciously inferring disease dynamics from typical wildlife samples. Our analysis of the model in light of the 1994 outbreak data strongly suggest that, although lions are sufficiently well connected to sustain epidemics of CDV-like diseases, the 1994 epidemic was fuelled by multiple spillovers from other carnivore species, such as jackals and hyenas.},

On mango flesh, survival time varied depending on temperature and fruit pH, ranging from 2h to more than 2 days. Desiccation of viruses substantially reduced survival time to less than 2h. The sensitivity of henipaviruses to pH, temperature and desiccation indicates a need for close contact between hosts for transmission to occur, although under ideal conditions henipaviruses can persist for extended periods facilitating vehicle-borne transmission.},

Here, we performed a spatio-temporal analysis of NiV entry into the CNS of hamsters. NiV initially predominantly targeted the olfactory epithelium in the nasal turbinates. From there, NiV infected neurons were visible extending through the cribriform plate into the olfactory bulb, providing direct evidence of rapid CNS entry. Subsequently, NiV disseminated to the olfactory tubercle and throughout the ventral cortex. Transmission electron microscopy on brain tissue showed extravasation of plasma cells, neuronal degeneration and nucleocapsid inclusions in affected tissue and axons, providing further evidence for axonal transport of NiV. NiV entry into the CNS coincided with the occurrence of respiratory disease, suggesting that the initial entry of NiV into the CNS occurs simultaneously with, rather than as a result of, systemic virus replication.},

In 2 of the 3 animals, HeV RNA was detected continually in nasal swabs from as early as 2 days postexposure, indicating that systemic spread of the virus may be preceded by local viral replication in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx.

	abstract = {Hendra virus (HeV) is a lethal paramyxovirus which emerged in humans in 1994. Poor understanding of HeV dynamics in Pteropus spp. (flying fox or fruit bat) reservoir hosts has limited our ability to determine factors driving its emergence. We initiated a longitudinal field study of HeV in little red flying foxes (LRFF; Pteropus scapulatus) and examined individual and population risk factors for infection, to determine probable modes of intraspecific transmission. We also investigated whether seasonal changes in host behaviour, physiology and demography affect host-pathogen dynamics. Data showed that pregnant and lactating females had significantly higher risk of infection, which may explain previously observed temporal associations between HeV outbreaks and flying fox birthing periods. Age-specific seroprevalence curves generated from field data imply that HeV is transmitted horizontally via faeces, urine or saliva. Rapidly declining seroprevalence between two field seasons suggests that immunity wanes faster in LRFF than in other flying fox species, and highlights the potentially critical role of this species in interspecific viral persistence. The highest seroprevalence was observed when animals showed evidence of nutritional stress, suggesting that environmental processes that alter flying fox food sources, such as habitat loss and climate change, may increase HeV infection and transmission. These insights into the ecology of HeV in flying fox populations suggest causal links between anthropogenic environmental change and HeV emergence.},

A significant relationship between finding antibodies against the virus in serum (seroprevalence) in goats and the autumnal cooling rate was detected, indicating that the transmission intensity of the virus does not only vary spatially, but also in relation to climatic factors. Virus seroprevalence in goats was correlated with the occurrence of TBE in humans and also with the average number of forestry workers' tick bites, demonstrating that serological screening of domestic animals, combined with an analysis of the autumnal cooling rate, can be used as early-warning predictors of TBE risk in humans.},

	abstract = {RNA viruses exploit all known mechanisms of genetic variation to ensure their survival. Distinctive features of RNA virus replication include high mutation rates, high yields, and short replication times. As a consequence, RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, called viral quasispecies. Mutation rates at defined genomic sites are affected by the nucleotide sequence context on the template molecule as well as by environmental factors. In vitro hypermutation reactions offer a means to explore the functional sequence space of nucleic acids and proteins. The evolution of a viral quasispecies is extremely dependent on the population size of the virus that is involved in the infections. Repeated bottleneck events lead to average fitness losses, with viruses that harbor unusual, deleterious mutations. In contrast, large population passages result in rapid fitness gains, much larger than those so far scored for cellular organisms. Fitness gains in one environment often lead to fitness losses in an alternative environment. An important challenge in RNA virus evolution research is the assignment of phenotypic traits to specific mutations. Different constellations of mutations may be associated with a similar biological behavior. In addition, recent evidence suggests the existence of critical thresholds for the expression of phenotypic traits. Epidemiological as well as functional and structural studies suggest that RNA viruses can tolerate restricted types and numbers of mutations during any specific time point during their evolution. Viruses occupy only a tiny portion of their potential sequence space. Such limited tolerance to mutations may open new avenues for combating viral infections.},

Since the initial reporting of the idea, little work as been undertaken to apply the proposed concept to potential ecosystem engineers in the marine environment. Biological and ecological data for the burrowing ghost shrimp Callianassa filholi (Decapoda: Thalassinidea) allowed for a formal assessment of this species as an ecosystem engineer, in direct accordance with published criteria. Despite a low population density and the short durability of its burrow structures, Callianassa filholi affected a number of resource flows by its large lifetime per capita activity. Ecosystem effects were evident in significant changes in macrofauna community composition over small spatial and temporal scales. Seasonal variation in the effects of ghost shrimp activity were associated with changes in seagrass (Zostera ovazelandica) biomass, which revealed the probability of interactions between antagonistic ecosystem engineers. The formal assessment of Callianassa filholi provides the opportunity to aid discussion pertaining to the development of the ecosystem engineering concept.},

	abstract = {Bufo periglenes, the golden toad, is an endangered species endemic to Costa Rica. Every year from the early 1970s through 1987 golden toads have emerged from retreats to breed during April-June. The most recent known breeding episode occurred during April-May 1987; more than 1500 adults were observed at five breeding pools, but a maximum of 29 tadpoles metamorphosed from these sites. During April-June 1988-90, we found only 11 toads during surveys of the breeding habitat. To examine the species' apparent decline, we analyzed data on rainfall, water temperature, and pH of the breeding pools. Our baseline data on weather patterns and characteristics of the breeding habitat suggest that warmer water temperatures and less advective precipitation during dry season post-1987 may have produced adverse breeding conditions. The toads may be alive and hiding in retreats awaiting appropriate weather conditions. The apparent scarcity of toads may reflect a normal population response to an unpredictable environment. On the other hand, because other anurans with different breeding specializations seem to be declining from the area as well, one wonders whether warmer temperatures and dry conditions could be responsible for real population declines. Because the habitat is protected and pristine, potential causes of anuran declines such as habitat destruction, introduced predators, and collecting seem unlikely. Measurements of pH of the breeding pools, cloud water, and precipitation do not suggest acid precipitation effects, although we cannot rule out the possibility of environmental degradation some time prior to our measurements. Long-term monitoring programs combined with carefully controlled field experiments are needed to address factors responsible for declining amphibians.},

	abstract = {Many species of climbing frog possess large disc-like digital pads, which facilitate adhesion. The consensus of earlier studies is that frogs depend on a wet adhesive mechanism, chiefly influenced by pad area and surface tension properties of the mediating adhesive fluid. The relationship between morphology, size and adhesion is of particular interest for tree frogs, because evolution of adhesive ability has facilitated niche expansion into arboreal habitats. If frogs are geometrically similar, and growth occurs isometrically, then mass will increase at a higher rate than toe-pad area, and an adhesive system directly dependent on area may be adversely affected. We investigated scaling of adhesive ability with ontogeny in seven species of hylid tree frog to test whether the responses to the challenges of maintaining adhesion with growth were sufficient to allow adult frogs to stick as effectively on smooth substrates as juvenile frogs. In all species, mass increased at a lower rate than expected with isometric growth. This was less pronounced in larger species, perhaps owing to the demands of locomotory modes such as jumping. In smaller hylids, this non-isometric increase in mass was sufficient to enable adult frogs to adhere as effectively as juveniles. In larger species, however, the ability of adult frogs to adhere was significantly lower than that of juveniles, despite evidence of increased toe-pad efficiency. Within all species adhesive forces increased at a greater rate than toe-pad area, suggestive of changes in the relative influence of the contributory components of the wet adhesive mechanism with growth.},

	abstract = {In this paper we develop a method for the general monitoring of the biodiversity in (sub)urban parks. The method works along two lines, that of habitat diversity and that of species diversity. On the habitat level we measure the diversity in so called 'habitat units'. These units are divided in planar, linear and punctual elements. For each category we calculate a Shannon-Wiener diversity index and a saturation index. The latter is the ratio of the diversity index compared to the maximum diversity possible. On the species level we use the species number and diversity index of vascular plants, as measured in random sampling plots of 100 m(2) (for trees and shrubs) and 4 m(2) (for herbaceous vegetation). In addition, we also use the species number of butterflies, amphibians and breeding birds. These numbers are compared with the total species number in Flanders, resulting in a saturation index per park for butterflies, amphibians and breeding birds. In this way 20 biodiversity indicators are obtained. The proposed method was applied to the municipal park of Loppem (West-Flanders, Belgium), from which the necessary time budget has been calculated. Since it is the first application of a new method and no reference to other parks is available, the proposed bioindicators have been compared with criteria given in the literature on the selection of biodiversity indicators.

	abstract = {In many respects, amphibian spatial dynamics resemble classical metapopulation models, in which subpopulations in breeding ponds blink in and out of existence and extinction and colonization rates are functions of pond spatial arrangement. This "ponds-as-patches" view of amphibian spatial dynamics is useful in several respects. First, it highlights the importance of regional and landscape processes in determining local patterns of abundance. Second, it offers a straightforward, pond-based approach to monitoring and managing amphibian populations. For many species, however, the ponds-as-patches view may be an over-simplification and metapopulation structure may be more apparent than real. Changes in distribution may be caused by processes other than extinction and recolonization, and most extinctions probably result from deterministic factors, not stochastic processes. In addition, the effects of pond isolation appear to be important primarily in disturbed environments, and in many cases these isolation effects may be better explained by the distribution of terrestrial habitats than by the distribution of breeding ponds. These complications have important implications for both researchers and managers. For researchers, future efforts need to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of abundance and distributional change and patterns in amphibian populations. For managers, effective conservation strategies must successfully balance metapopulation considerations with careful attention to local habitat quality. Furthermore, translocations and active management may be indispensable tools for conserving amphibians in landscapes containing multiple breeding ponds.},

	abstract = {Monitoring programs serve to track changes in the distribution and abundance of species. A major problem with most monitoring programs is that species detection is imperfect and some populations are inevitably missed. Therefore, in most monitoring programs the true distribution of a species will be underestimated. Here, we report a field test of the reliability and performance of a commonly used method to monitor the distribution of amphibians (anuran call surveys). We surveyed the distribution of four anuran species in western Switzerland, and estimated detection probabilities to account for imperfect species detection and used these estimates to adjust our estimate of site occupancy (i.e., distribution). Next, we assessed how detection probabilities were affected by weather and how site occupancy was affected by site specific covariates. For one species (Hyla arborea), call surveys proved efficient in determining the regional distribution with only few site visits because detection probabilities were relatively high. The call surveys apparently missed many populations of another common species (Bufo calamita) because detection probabilities were lower. Two other species (Bombina variegata and Alytes obstetricans) were uncommon and strong inference from the analysis is not possible. Thus, multispecies surveys may be inefficient for rare species. Estimates of detection probabilities were used to calculate how many site visits are necessary to infer the absence of a species with some predetermined statistical certainty. The implications of "false absences" are important in ecology as they are known to bias usual habitat suitability models and overestimate extinction/colonization events in metapopulations. Large-scale monitoring programs would benefit from the application of an estimation-based approach to monitoring the distribution of species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial salamanders of the family Plethodontidae have unique attributes that make them excellent indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity in forested habitats. Their longevity, small territory size, site fidelity, sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic perturbations, tendency to occur in high densities, and low sampling costs mean that counts of plethodontid salamanders provide numerous advantages over counts of other North American forest organisms for indicating environmental change. Furthermore, they are tightly linked physiologically to microclimatic and successional processes that influence the distribution and abundance of numerous other hydrophilic but difficult-to-study forest dwelling plants and animals. Ecosystem process such as moisture cycling, food-wed dynamics, and succession, with their related structural and microclimatic variability, all affect forest biodiversity and have been shown to affect salamander populations as well. We determined the variability associated with sampling for plethodontid salamanders by estimating the coefficient of variation (CV) from available time-series data. The median coefficient of variation indicated that variation in counts of individuals among studies was much lower in plethodontids (27\%) than in lepidoptera (93\%), passerine birds (57\%), small mammals (69\%), or other amphibians (37-46\%), which means plethodontid salamanders provide an important statistical advantage over other species for monitoring long-term forest health.},

	volume = {121},
	abstract = {The general principles of scale and coarse and fine filters have been widely accepted, but management agencies and industry are still grappling with the question of what to monitor to detect changes in forest biodiversity following forest management. Part of this problem can be attributed to the lack of focused questions for monitoring including absence of null models and predicted effects, a certain level of disconnect between research and management, and recognition that monitoring can be designed as a research question. Considerable research from the past decade has not been adequately synthesized to answer important questions, such as which species or forest attributes might be the best indicators of change. A disproportionate research emphasis has been placed on community ecology, and mostly on a few groups of organisms including arthropods, amphibians, migratory songbirds, and small mammals, while other species, including soil organisms, lichens, bats, raptors, some carnivores, and larger mammals remain less well-known. In most studies of community ecology, the question of what is the importance, if any, of the regularly observed subtle changes in community structures, and causes of observed changes is usually not answered. Hence, our ability to deal with questions of persistence is limited, and demographic research on regionally–defined key species (such as species linked to processes, species whose persistence may be affected, species with large home ranges, species already selected as indicators, and rare and threatened species) is urgently needed. Monitoring programs need to be designed to enable managers to respond to unexpected changes caused by forest management. To do this, management agencies need to articulate null models for monitoring that predict effects, focus fine-scale monitoring on key species (defined by local and regional research) in key habitats (rare, declining, important) across landscapes, and have a protocol in place to adapt management strategies to changes observed. Finally, agencies must have some way to determine and define when a significant change has occurred and to predict the persistence of species; this too should flow from a well-designed null model.},

	volume = {136},
	abstract = {Much of metapopulation theory assumes that the persistence of individual populations in a metapopulation, and persistence of the metapopulation as a whole, is best modeled by the area of habitat patches and their isolation. Estimates of isolation typically include a measure of geographic distance and a measure of either population size or patch area. This ” area and isolation paradigm ” assumes a functional relationship between the area of a patch and its extinction probability, and between isolation of a patch and its colonization probability, Although these assumptions are fundamental to use of incidence function models of metapopulation dynamics, the assumptions have been validated in only a small number of studies. We tested the ability of area and isolation to predict extinction and colonization patterns using multiple-year occupancy data for 10 species from three taxonomic groups (butterflies, amphibians, and birds). We examined 13 potential models of metapopulation dynamics. All models included four basic parameters: occupancy during the first year of the survey, probability of extinction, probability of colonization, and single-visit detection probability. In eight models, each parameter was either constant or time-dependent. Five models included a patch-level covariate of extinction probability (patch area or population size), colonization probability (connectivity, the inverse of isolation), or both. Extinction patterns generally were predicted more effectively as a function of local population size than as a function of patch area, a constant probability of extinction, or a time-dependent probability of extinction. In most cases, inclusion of connectivity as a patch-level covariate did not improve predictions of colonization patterns. We estimated single-visit detection probabilities for all species in our analyses, thus providing evidence-based guidelines for the refinement of future monitoring protocols. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For nine years, Mayamon volunteers censused anuran populations using a protocol that estimates numbers of individuals on the basis of male vocalization. To date, the protocol has been evaluated only through a series of post hoc power analyses; I performed the first field test to assess the effect of species-specific mating system characteristics, survey length, survey frequency, and pond selection on census results for anuran communities within a tropical moist forest in Belize. Under the current protocol, it would take, on average, 359 months of sampling to detect the 11 species I detected at this site using vocalization surveys. In addition, I introduce a method using ANCOVA to determine ideal survey length. Arbitrarily setting the ideal detection to 90\% yields a required sampling protocol of 21 minutes; the current minimum of 15 min yields only an 80\% detection rate. This method could be adapted for use with other monitoring programs, allowing both the assessment of current efficacy and the extrapolation of required sampling length to reach a given efficacy. The results of these approaches indicate that the Mayamon protocol methodology should be extended if it is to allow investigators to adequately understand the community dynamics of amphibians.},

On average, a minimum of four nights of survey was required to detect the range of amphibian species present at a site. Nocturnal stream searches and automatic tape recorders were robust in the range of conditions encountered during the survey, with no significant relationships found between temporal or spatial variation in their performance and weather or site conditions.

	title = {Identifying the minimal demographic unit for monitoring pond-breeding amphibians},
	volume = {14},
	abstract = {Amphibians are declining globally, and efforts are underway to establish long-term programs to monitor population trends. Because researchers are constrained to sampling a small subset of populations that Occur across a landscape, monitoring units should be selected that maximize the statistical independence of population responses to environmental stressors. Breeding sites of pond-breeding amphibians are often Clustered locally, and habitat switching between neighboring ponds could significantly compromise both demographic and statistical independence. This raises a fundamental issue of whether the basic monitoring unit for trend analysis should be an individual pond or a cluster of local ponds. To help resolve the degree of demographic independence within a cluster of local ponds, we conducted a spatial-scale analysis of breeding-population synchrony of the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) in four national parks in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee, USA. We used the number of egg masses deposited annually from 1993 through 2002 as an index of relative breeding-population size and used correlation coefficients of annual percentage change in population size as an index of synchrony. Within parks, synchrony for both species was independent of the distance between ponds and was lower between paired ponds within a local cluster compared with paired comparisons of geographically isolated groups. These patterns indicate a lack of demographic independence within clusters and tire consistent with field observations of wholesale shifting of local pond populations to adjoining ponds. Habitat shifting occurred primarily in response to beaver activity that created new ponds or allowed fish to invade fish-free habitats. Ambystoma maculatum shifted habitats less frequently and exhibited higher levels of within-Cluster population synchrony than R. sylvatica. Turnovers occurred for local pond populations for both species and at higher rates for R. sylvatica. However, no local pond cluster experienced a turnover event during the study. Our data suggest that pond populations that are only a few hundred meters apart are not demographically independent and are best treated as subpopulations of the same monitoring unit. We discuss the implications of these findings for amphibian-monitoring programs that are designed to assess population trends.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {Ecological restoration is one of the fastest growing fields in applied ecology providing new ideas and opportunities for biological conservation and natural resource management. Despite countless attempts in the past, large portions of restoration projects have been considered unsuccessful mainly due to: unrealistic goals; inadequate restoration plans based on an ad-hoc approach; lack of explicit and quantified evaluation criteria for restoration success; lack of ecological understanding; social, economic, and political constraints; or combinations of these factors. Existing ecological theories, particularly succession theories, may provide a conceptual framework for a restoration trajectory. However, projecting a ‘desirable' trajectory and outcome is often challenged by the unpredictability of ecological communities in the changing environment. Particularly, the sustainability of reconstructed ‘historic' ecosystems appears to be an unlikely goal in the ever-changing and unpredictable future environment. This paper calls for a shift in the restoration paradigm from ‘historic' to ‘futuristic.' A ‘futuristic' restoration is: (i) to set realistic and dynamic (instead of static) goals for future, instead of past, environment; (ii) to assume multiple trajectories acknowledging the unpredictable nature of ecological communities and ecosystems; (iii) to take an ecosystem or landscape approach, instead of ad-hoc gardening, for both function and structure; (iv) to evaluate the restoration progress with explicit criteria, based on quantitative inference; and (v) to maintain long-term monitoring of restoration outcomes. A theoretical framework for ‘futuristic' restoration, in terms of goals, trajectories, evaluation criteria, and monitoring, along with a historical perspective is presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {The largest genus of salamanders, Bolitoglossa (Plethodontidae), is widespread in tropical America, where it occurs in diverse habitats and elevations, from high elevation grasslands to lowland rain forest. It has the most extensive geographical range of any salamander genus. While most species occur in Middle America, it ranges throughout most of tropical South America as well. Phylogenetic analysis of 1196 bp of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b, 16S RNA) from 55 species offers strong support for the monophyly of the genus and sorts the species into a number of clades. Taking into account morphology, distribution, general ecology, and prior systematic and taxonomic studies, we recognize seven subgenera, four of them new: Bolitoglossa Dumeril, Bibron et Dumeril, 1854, Eladinea Miranda Ribeiro, 1937, Magnadigita Taylor, 1944, Mayamandra, Nanotriton, Oaxakia and Pachymandra. All South American and some lower Middle American species are included in a single well supported clade, Eladinea. At the species level our analyses uncover the existence of large genetic diversity within morphologically homogeneous taxa. We propose the new combination: B. (Eladinea) paraensis (Unterstein, 1930) stat. nov., for Brazilian salamanders previously included under B. altamazonica. We evaluate evidence for the multiple colonization of the tropical lowlands by morphologically derived species groups. South America was invaded by members of one clade, Eladinea, which we infer to have dispersed to South America prior to closure of the Panamanian Portal. Despite the relatively long history of salamanders in South America, that continent now accounts for a relatively small proportion of the lineages and species of neotropical salamanders.

	abstract = {The relationship of anuran breeding site biodiversity to land use was examined in southeast Kansas, USA. Eight breeding pools or temporary ponds were sampled from March to July 1995. Each site has some adjacent woodland, but varied in the remaining adjacent land use. Two sites were relatively unimpacted reference or “natural” sites, two were impacted by abandoned coal or lead/zinc mines, and four were impacted by cropland. Adult density was determined with visual and audio censuses. Tadpoles were examined for malformations and density was estimated. Eggs were collected from the sites, hatched in the laboratory, and examined for malformations. Total audio anuran density was statistically higher (ANOVA, P{\textbackslash}textless0.05) in natural area breeding pools (1,048.7/ha) compared to pools in agricultural (519.0/ha) and mined areas (164.8/ha). Visual densities followed the same pattern (459.9/ha natural {\textbackslash}textgreater 315.1/ha agricultural {\textbackslash}textgreater 262.0/ha mined) but were not statistically different. Tadpole densities were significantly (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05) higher in natural area breeding pools (137.6/m2) compared to agricultural (59.4/m2) and mined areas (28.5/m2). The percentage of tadpoles with malformations was significantly lower (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05) in natural areas (0.4\%) compared to agricultural (4.6\%) and mining (8.3\%). Malformations found in the field included spinal cord, optic, edemas, and tumors. Eggs incubated from natural sites had significantly (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05) higher percentages of eggs hatching successfully (98.8\%) and lower percentages of tadpoles with malformations (17.5\%) than did eggs from agricultural (88.2\% and 51.0\%, respectively) and mined areas (40.4\% and 76.1\%, respectively). Eggs incubated from natural sites also had the lowest malformation rate (17.5\%) compared to eggs from agricultural sites (51.0\%) and mined sites (76.1\%), but these differences were not statistically different. These data provide evidence for the link between land use and the individual and population characteristics of anurans in breeding pools.},

	abstract = {The reasons ecosystems should be restored are numerous, disparate, generally understated, and commonly underappreciated.We offer a typology in which these reasons—or motivations—are ordered among five rationales: technocratic, biotic, heuristic, idealistic, and pragmatic. The technocratic rationale encompasses restoration that is conducted by government agencies or other large organizations to satisfy specific institutional missions and mandates. The biotic rationale for restoration is to recover lost aspects of local biodiversity. The heuristic rationale attempts to elicit or demonstrate ecological principles and biotic expressions. The idealistic rationale consists of personal and cultural expressions of concern or atonement for environmental degradation, reengagement with nature, and/or spiritual fulfillment. The pragmatic rationale seeks to recover or repair ecosystems for their capacity to provide a broad array of natural services and products upon which human economies depend and to counteract extremes in climate caused by ecosystem loss. We propose that technocratic restoration, as currently conceived and practiced, is too narrow in scope and should be broadened to include the pragmatic rationale whose overarching importance is just beginning to be recognized. We suggest that technocratic restoration is too authoritarian, that idealistic restoration is overly restricted by lack of administrative strengths, and that a melding of the two approaches would benefit both. Three recent examples are given of restoration that blends the technocratic, idealistic, and pragmatic rationales and demonstrates the potential for a more unified approach. The biotic and heuristic rationales can be satisfied within the contexts of the other rationales.},

Streams in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, are subject to episodic acidification from precipitation events. We surveyed 25 in by 2 in transects located on the stream bank adjacent to the water channel in Shenandoah National Park for salamanders using a stratified random sampling design based on elevation, aspect and bedrock geology. A, We investigated the relationships of four species (Eurycea bislineata, Desmognathus fuscus, D. monticola and Gyrinophilus porphyriticus) to habitat and water quality variables. We did not find overwhelming evidence that stream salamanders are affected by the acid-base status of streams in Shenandoah National Park. Desmognathus fuscus and D. monticola abundance was greater both in streams that had a higher potential to neutralize acidification, and in higher elevation ({\textbackslash}textgreater 700 m) streams. Neither abundance of E. bislineata nor species richness were related to any of the habitat variables. Our sampling method preferentially detected the adult age class of the study species and did not allow us to estimate Population sizes. We suggest that continued monitoring of stream salamander populations in SNP will determine the effects of stream acidification on these taxa.},

	abstract = {The hylid frog genus Scinax ranges from southern Mexico to eastern Argentina. The 84 recognized species are currently arranged in five groups: the Scinax rubra, Scinax rostrata, Scinax catharinae, Scinax staufferi, and Scinax perpusilla species groups. Although a few species groups are distinctive, compelling evidence of monophyly is lacking for three groups, and their interrelationships remain virtually unknown. With the objective of testing the monophyly of the species groups and exploring their interrelationships, a cladistic analysis was performed, employing 86 characters from osteology, myology, adult and larval external morphology, reproductive biology, and karyotypes taken from 36 representative species of the five species groups plus eight outgroup taxa. The analysis of the resulting data matrix shows moderately well-supported (as assessed through Bremer support and parsimony jackknifing) S. catharinae and S. rostrata species groups. The S. staufferi species group is polyphyletic, as currently composed, given that some of its species are nested within the S. catharinae species group. The only representative of the S. perpusilla species group is the sister species of the S. catharinae species group. Although weakly supported, the representatives of the S. rostrata and S. staufferi species groups are nested, separately, within the S. rubra species group. In order to have a taxonomy consistent with these results, it is proposed not to recognize the S. rubra group but to recognize a more inclusive rubra clade that includes all studied exemplars of the former S. rubra group, plus some of the S. staufferi group and all of the S. rostrata group. Similarly, a catharinae clade is recognized, within which all studied exemplars of the S. catharinae group (that now includes Scinax berthae and Scinax agilis) and the one studied representative of the S. perpusilla group are included.

	abstract = {1. Monitoring programmes serve to track changes in the distribution and abundance of species. A major problem with most monitoring programmes is that species detection is imperfect and some populations are inevitably missed. Estimates of abundance and distribution are biased when detection probabilities are not taken into account. 2. Data were analysed from a large-scale volunteer-based amphibian monitoring programme using recently developed methods for estimating site Occupancy. The analysis revealed that detection probabilities were much smaller than 100\%, and varied among species and between years in an unpredictable way despite the fact that standardized field methods were used. Different environmental covariates best explained variation in detection probabilities among species and between years. It is therefore very difficult to standardize field methods in a way that eliminates such variation. 3. When detection probabilities were not taken into account, estimates of the proportion of sites where a species occurred and estimates of trends in site occupancy were biased. Bias was large and was related to detection probability. 4. Site occupancy models are a useful tool for monitoring the distribution of amphibians (and other animals and plants). These methods should be useful for assessing 'favourable conservation status' as required under the European Habitats Directive. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Based on 627 samples, we examined 3 types of observer bias: omission, false inclusion (commission), and incorrect identification. Misidentification rates ranged from 4.2\% to 18.3\%.

We combined broad-scale field sampling with historical analyses of museum records to quantify amphibian declines in California's Great Central Valley. Overall, amphibians showed an unambiguous pattern of decline, although the intensity of decline varied both geographically and taxonomically. The greatest geographical decline was detected in the counties of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. Two species, Rana aurora and Bufo boreas were identified as the most affected by decline, whereas Pseudacris regilla was the least affected. The Coast Range counties has little or no detectable decline. We provide new evidence implicating introduced predators as a primary threat. Introduced predators occur at lower elevations that native species, and our data indicate that for some native species there has been significant restriction to higher elevation sites from a formerly broader distribution. Our historical approach provides a strategy for identifying declining amphibian communities that complements more detailed, long-term monitoring programs and provides an assessment of the pattern of change that is a necessary prerequisite for the development of field experiments that test hypothesized mechanisms of change.},

However, the relative importance of these two predictors is poorly understood because for est cover in the landscape is usually negatively correlated with the density of roads and traffic. To evaluate the independent effects of traffic and forest cover, we selected 36 ponds near Ottawa, Canada, at the center of four landscape types: low forest/low traffic; low for est/high traffic; high forest/low traffic; and high forest/high traffic, where traffic and forest cover were measured within 100 - 2000 in of the edge of each pond. We surveyed all ponds in 2005 and re-surveyed a 23-pond subset in 2006. The negative association between species richness and traffic density was stronger (partial R-2=0.34; P {\textbackslash}textless.001) than the positive asso ciation of species richness with forest cover (partial R-2=0.10; P {\textbackslash}textgreater.05) in the landscape. Three of six common species showed stronger associations with traffic density than with forest cover - Bufo americanus, Rana pipiens, and Hyla versicolor; two species - Pseudacris cru cifer and Rana syluatica - showed stronger associations with forest cover than with traffic; while Raria clamitans showed similar associations with traffic and forest cover. Our results show that the overall negative effect of traffic on anuran populations in northeastern North America is at least as great as the negative effect of deforestation, and also that the relative effects of these two predictors on anuran abundance vary between species.

Methods: In this study, the data of 42 dogs with the diagnosis of leptospirosis were evaluated retrospectively. Dogs were presented to the Small Animal Medicine Teaching Hospital (Medizinische Kleintierklinik) of the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich, Germany, between 1990 to 2003. Results: Reactivity to the serogroup grippotyphosa (13/42) was most frequently present, followed by reactivity to the serogroup saxkoebing (10/42). There was no difference in the clinical picture and the laboratory changes between dogs whose sera were reactive to different serogroups. Clinical Signicance: Most of the dogs with leptospirosis in southern Germany had sera reacting to serogroups other than icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola, which are contained in the vaccine. Thus, currently available vaccines in Europe do not protect against the most common Leptospira organisms associated with clinical disease.},

	abstract = {The positivity to leptospirosis in wild rodents, captured at swine farms from the central coffee growers area of Colombia, by mean of Sherman traps was investigated. Seventy five rats and mice were trapped at 12 out of 16 farms, which indicates that rodents's infestation at the area is high. Once the rodents were classified, the specie R. rattus was found more frequently than R. norvegicus and musculus. A high proportion of the rodents was found Leptospira positive by dark field examination, as well as by cultivation, being this last technique more efficient for the diagnosis. In addition, the point prevalence found for leptospirosis in urine, was higher than the one found by the MAT. Concerning the results of Leptospira in visceras, it was found that the probability of a positive diagnosis by dark field examination was: lung 0.307; liver 0.221; and kidney 0.211; while the probability of cultivation positive was: kidney 0.300; liver 0.260; and lung 0.227. From this study it was concluded, that the high rodent infestation at the area under study, is a risk factor for leptospira. infection for domestic animals and human beings, and that the hog producers should make a great effort to control this pest, which causes a severe economical and health impact.},

Genes were cloned and the proteins expressed in E. coli. Immunoblotting analysis of the recombinants with sera from early and convalescent phases of a leptospirosis patient showed that two proteins, namely Lp29 and Lp49, were reactive with serum from both phases of the illness. These data were further confirmed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using sera from both phases of seventeen confirmed leptospirosis specimens, suggesting that these proteins are presented to the host immune system during infection. In the early phase, anti-Lp29 IgM was detected in all sera when microscopic agglutination tests (MAT), the reference method for diagnosis of leptospirosis, were negative. The gene encoding Lp49 is conserved among five tested leptospiral pathogenic serovars, while Lp29 is present in serovars that are predominant in urban settings. These recombinant antigens might be valuable for serodiagnosis of both phases of leptospirosis.},

	abstract = {Background. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and its incidence is known in Chile since 2002, when it was incorporated as a disease that must be reported to health authorities. A serologic survey for leptospirosis was performed in humans and animals from a farm in a semi urban area in Santiago Chile, after the death of a farmer due to Weil disease in that place. Aim: To report the prevalence of antibodies against leptospirosis and to determine exposure to infection risk factors in the humans and domestic animals studied in this survey. Material and methods: Antibodies were detected by IgM immunodot and indirect haemagglutination test in 61 humans (43 male, aged 5 to 70 years) and by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) in 44 animals. A questionnaire was applied to determine their exposure to risk factors for infection with Leptospira. Results: Seventy two percent of the studied population were farm workers and 70\% had activities that required contact with water from canals, 41\% cleaned closed places where rodents were present. Other risk factors detected were lack of sewage and waste disposal, high level of rodent infestation and disposal of faeces into canals used for watering. Two humans (3.3\%) and six animals (1 bovine and 5 rodents) had positive antibodies. Among animals, antibodies against Leptospira serovar pomona and icterohaemorragiae were detected. Conclusions: In Chile, leptospirosis exists not only in rural areas but semi urban ones close to Santiago, although the prevalence is low. Education is necessary among semi urban population to avoid infection.},

Two hundred and twenty-two A. agrarius were captured during October-December 1996. Spirochaetes were isolated from 22 (9.9 \%) and leptospiral DNA was detected in an additional 6 rodents (12.6 \%). Subsequent microscopic agglutination tests (MAT) classified all these isolates as L. interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae serovar lai.

	abstract = {Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, is the site of the only two recognized outbreaks of primary pneumonic tularemia in the United States. Beginning in 2000 and continuing through 2006, 59 presumed or confirmed tularemia cases have been reported from Martha's Vineyard, with more than 60\% of these presumed to be due to inhalation of the agent. A joint CDC/Massachusetts Department of Public Health case-control study identified landscaping activities such as lawnmowing or brush cutting to be important risk factors. The fomites that serve as the basis for risk for landscapers, however, remain unidentified. Clinically, cases generally have a pneumonic component, but the development of pulmonary signs can be greatly delayed. The spectrum of illness ranges from relatively mild disease, in which cases may be treated on an outpatient basis, to severe illness requiring hospitalization. In each scenario, gentamicin therapy tends to rapidly induce defervescence, although exceptions have been noted. Even with heightened awareness during the current outbreak, physicians may easily miss a diagnosis of tularemia, usually by attributing illness to the more common Febrile illnesses. Dog ticks appear to maintain the agent on this island, with as many as 5\% infected by the agent of tularemia. The main hosts for dog ticks, skunks and raccoons, are very frequently seroreactive, suggesting the possibility for their involvement in environmental contamination due to their peridomestic habits. Why tularemia is prevalent on Martha's Vineyard and why it commonly presents as a pneumonic disease there remain undescribed.},

It occurs in urban environments of industrialised and developing countries, as well as in rural regions worldwide. Mortality remains significant, related both to delays in diagnosis due to lack of infrastructure and adequate clinical suspicion, and to other poorly understood reasons that may include inherent pathogenicity of some leptospiral strains or genetically determined host immunopathological responses. Pulmonary haemorrhage is recognised increasingly as a major, often lethal, manifestation of leptospirosis, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. The completion of the genome sequence of Leptospira interrogans serovar lai, and other continuing leptospiral genome sequencing projects, promise to guide future work on the disease. Mainstays of treatment are still tetracyclines and beta-lactam/cephalosporins. No vaccine is available.

Twelve serovars included in the study were: australis, autumnalis, ballum, bataviae, bratislava, canicola, copenhageni, grippotyphosa, hardjo, pomona, pyrogenes, and tarassovi. Fifty-two (11\%) sera had antibody titers of greater than or equal to 1:50 against one or more serovars of L. interrogans. The seroprevalence of different serovars in decreasing order was: grippotyphosa, bratislava, autumnalis, canicola, pomona, ballum, pyrogenes, hardjo, and copenhageni.

Samples collected postmortem, including placenta, uterine fluid, and fetal tissues, were also positive for NiV genome, and the placenta and uterine fluid contained high levels of recoverable virus. The high levels of viral shedding in the adult combined with fetal viral replication suggests that both vertical and horizontal transmission of NiV could play a role in spillover events, an essential element in the epidemiology of Henipavirus infection.},

Either by alterations in natural habitats and diversity or by chance, pathogens emerge from time to time. This book addresses various aspects of such emergences, such as pathogenetic mechanisms of viruses, diagnosis of viral infections, viral host-management strategies, viral genetics, vaccine development and application. It is especially valuable for laboratory virologists, disease ecologists, physicians, and those who want to understand the complexities of viral characteristics.},

	abstract = {Three newly recognized encephalitogenic zoonotic viruses spread from fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (order Chiroptera, suborder Megachiroptera) have been recognised over the past decade. These are: Hendra virus, formerly named equine morbillivirus, which was responsible for an outbreak of disease in horses and humans in Brisbane, Australia, in 1994; Australian bat lyssavirus, the cause of a severe acute encephalitis, in 1996; and Nipah virus, the cause of a major outbreak of encephalitis and pulmonary disease in domestic pigs and people in peninsula Malaysia in 1999. Hendra and Nipah viruses have been shown to be the first two members of a new genus, Henipavirus, in the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Paramyxovirinae, whereas Australian bat lyssavirus is closely related antigenically to classical rabies virus in the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae, although it can be distinguished on genetic grounds. Hendra and Nipah viruses have neurological and pneumonic tropisms. The first humans and equids with Hendra virus infections died from acute respiratory disease, whereas the second human patient died from an encephalitis. With Nipah virus, the predominant clinical syndrome in humans was encephalitic rather than respiratory, whereas in pigs, the infection was characterised by acute fever with respiratory involvement with or without neurological signs. Two human infections with Australian bat lyssavirus have been reported, the clinical signs of which were consistent with classical rabies infection and included a diffuse, non-suppurative encephalitis. Many important questions remain to be answered regarding modes of transmission, pathogenesis, and geographic range of these viruses.},

	abstract = {The role of stochasticity and its interplay with nonlinearity are central current issues in studies of the complex population patterns observed in nature, including the pronounced oscillations of wildlife and infectious diseases. The dynamics of childhood diseases have provided influential case studies to develop and test mathematical models with practical application to epidemiology, but are also of general relevance to the central question of whether simple nonlinear systems can explain and predict the complex temporal and spatial patterns observed in nature outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a stochastic theory for the major dynamical transitions in epidemics from regular to irregular cycles, which relies on the discrete nature of disease transmission and low spatial coupling. The full spectrum of stochastic fluctuations is derived analytically to show how the amplification of noise varies across these transitions. The changes in noise amplification and coherence appear robust to seasonal forcing, questioning the role of seasonality and its interplay with deterministic components of epidemiological models. Childhood diseases are shown to fall into regions of parameter space of high noise amplification. This type of "endogenous" stochastic resonance may be relevant to population oscillations in nonlinear ecological systems in general.},

Concordance between ELISA and MAT titers was measured by kappa (kappa). Overall prevalence was 35\%. The most prevalent serogroups were canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae. Positive samples showed titers between 1:100 and 1:25,600, with higher titers found in serogroups canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae. Positive serum samples fell within a range of 1.36-1.65.

Leptospirosis is a globally important emerging zoonosis, caused by spirochaete bacteria, borne by many mammalian hosts, and also transmitted environmentally. We propose that leptospirosis incidence in humans is also linked to ecosystem disruption, and that reduced biodiversity (the diversity of species within an ecological community) may be associated with increased leptospirosis incidence. To investigate this hypothesis, the relationship between biodiversity levels of island nations and their annual leptospirosis incidence rates (adjusted for GDP per capita) was examined by linear correlation and regression. Supportive, statistically significant negative associations were obtained between leptospirosis incidence and (a) total number of species (r2=0.69, p{\textbackslash}textless0.001) and (b) number of mammal species (r2=0.80, p{\textbackslash}textless0.001) in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis only the number of mammal species remained significantly associated (r2=0.81, p=0.007). An association between biodiversity and reduced leptospirosis risk, if supported by further research, would emphasise the importance of managing the emergence of leptospirosis (and other infectious diseases) at a broader, ecosystem level.},

Small mammals were caught in several areas of eastern Slovakia, an important part of host material comming from East Slovakian Lowland (45.7\%), south part of Kosice basin (26.5\%) and Slovak carst (10.1\%). Serological examinations were used by Kmety and Bakoss (1978), the sexual condition of rodents were ascertained after Pelikan (1965). Altogether, 2113 individuals of rodent species were examined during five years (1991-1995), antibodies to leptospires were demonstrated in 5.02\% of examined hosts. In examined hosts antibodies to six serovars of leptospira (Leptospira grippothyphosa, L. sejroe, L. bataviae, L. bratislava, L. pomona and L. sorex-jalna) were found. The most frequently observed antibodies were those of the serovar L. grippothyphosa (65.1\%) and L. sejroe (25.5\%). Slightly higher percentage of positive hosts in mature group rodents (5.4\%) comparing with immature rodents (4.6\%) were statistically insignificant. Similarly, no differences were found between percentage of positive rodent females (5.3\%) and group of males (4.7\%). No statistical differences were found in positivities to leptospira antibodies among sexual and age groups of individual rodent species, too. Proportion of serological positivities to L. grippothyphosa and L. sejroe in compared sex and age rodent groups were very similar. In evaluated rodent species trend of increases of serological positive values from spring to autumn was observed, but it was statistically confirmed only in A. agrarius.},

	abstract = {A guild of six species of intestinal protozoan (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) was monitored in 496 live-trapped Wyoming ground squirrels (Spermophilus elegans) in two populations in 1989 and 1990. Three species were present at high levels ({\textbackslash}textgreater40\% of all squirrels infected at any time) and three at low levels ({\textbackslash}textless20\% infected) in both populations within and across years. Results of logistic regression indicated that age of individual was a key parameter in predicting infection within each of the species. For the common species, adults had a higher probability of infection than juveniles and the observed number of reinfections in recaptured squirrels was slightly greater than predicted. For the three rare species, juveniles had a higher probability of infection than adults and there was a slight decrease in probability of reinfection. Over the two years, time of sampling had no effect on probability of infection. There was no evidence for negative interactions (competition) between guild members but several positive interactions were noted. This eimerian guild appears stable within these populations and we hypothesize that the three prevalent species are commensals (little or no effect on host fitness) and the three low prevalence species have a greater effect on host fitness (”parasite”). Further, some species of this assemblage also infect two other species of sciurids sympatric with the Wyoming ground squirrel. The processes important in structuring this assemblage may include the differential immune response of the host animals to the different eimerian species, the non-limiting resource base (the intestinal epithelia), the high reproductive capacities of the eimerian species, the varying ability of infective oocysts for each species to persist under ambient environmental conditions, the high colonization rates of host populations, and the ability of the symbionts to infect sympatric host species.},

A consistent, integrative approach to such research allows direct comparisons between studies, contributes to the efficient use of resources and data, and increases investigator safety. We outline steps directed toward understanding vertebrate host ecology as it relates to human disease and illustrate the relevance of each step by using examples from studies of hosts associated with rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses.},

	abstract = {Aim. To characterize persistence of the causative agent in the blood of patients with leptospirosis, to evaluate significance of the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with isolation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and microagglutination reaction (MAR) in diagnosis of leptospirosis at different stages of the disease. Material and methods. The study included 94 patients with leptospirosis: 51 (54.2\%) males, 43 (45.8\%) females, 74 (78.7\%) urban and 20 (21.3\%) rural citizens in acute leptospirosis, early and late convalescence. Leptospirosis was diagnosed on the basis of clinico-epidemiological, laboratory-device data. All the patients were divided into 2 groups: with leptospiral jaundice (n = 33, 35.1\%) and without leptospiral jaundice (n = 61, 64.9\%). The disease of moderate severity was in 64 (68916) patients. Verification of the diagnosis was based on determination of specific antibodies titer in MAR using standard set of diagnostic cultures. PCR determined rRNA of leptospira in the blood on the disease day 5, 10 and 15, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months after the disease onset. The results were processed with methods of parametric and non-parametric statistics. Conclusion. PCR demonstrated diagnostic value in early leptospirosis (sensitivity of the method in the disease week 1 was 86916). Diagnostic significance of MAR reached 81.8\% later - in 3 weeks. Detection of leptospiral rRNA by PCR in the autopsy material allows one to recommend this method for additional verification of the diagnosis including as an alternative to bacterioscopic test.},

Each animal was checked for infection by microscopical examination of fresh and stained urine, serological analysis of serum, and the culture of urine and kidney samples. Direct, dark-field, observation of fresh urine samples and examination of urine samples after Fontana's silver staining were found to be the least sensitive of the tests used. The results of the serological microscopic agglutination test (MAT) indicated that four (14.3\%) of the rats and nine (16.1\%) of the bandicoots had significant agglutinins, predominantly for the serogroups icterohaemorrhagiae and autumnalis.

The Perote ground squirrel (Spermophilus perotensis). a species endemic to Mexico, has a distribution limited to the states of Puebla and Veracruz. Its geographic range is restricted to a 100-km strip covering 2.457 km(2) in the El Oriental Basin, where they occur in only IG localities on arid plains and valleys at elevations of 2,200-2,700 m above sea level. Habitat destruction and fragmentation have been severe in tile El Oriental Basin, leading to small isolated populations with high probabilities of extinction, and threatening the long-term survival of the species. Mean distance between localities was 15.8 km, which clearly indicates the severity of fragmentation. The Perote ground squirrel is a good example of the conservation problems faced by many Mexican endemics. Conservation of these species should be a priority for Mexico.},

	volume = {103},
	abstract = {In spite of major successes against infectious diseases in the 20th century, new infectious diseases have emerged and old ones re-emerged in recent decades in different parts of the world. A brief survey of emerging and re-emerging bacterial diseases of public health importance in India is presented in this paper. Plague re-appeared in two outbreaks in Maharshtra and Gujarat in 1994, indicating a breakdown of the public health measures that had prevented its occurrence for several decades. Leptospirosis appears to be on the increase in Kerala, Tamilnadu and the Andamans during the last 2 decades, probably due to increased farming and inadequate rodent control. It is suggested that melioidosis due to the soil organism Burkholderia pseudomallei may be prevalent in many parts of India, but is under-diagnosed and under-reported. Since 1991, a completely new choleragenic Vibrio cholerae, designated 0139 has emerged in southern India and spread to other parts of India and to neighbouring countries, setting in motion the 8th cholera pandemic. Animal anthrax is very common in many parts of India, but human anthrax is recognised in only certain limited locations. In the Chittoor and North Arcot districts, its prevalence had increased in recent years. Since 1990, a multi-drug resistant variety of typhoid fever had been prevalent in many parts of India, caused by Salmonella typhi resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection seems to be widely prevalent in hospitals In many regions in India, and its prevalence seems to be on the rise. These pathogens pose new threats to public health. and call for appropriate responses. Microbiological expertise and epidemiological surveillance art deficient in the health care and public health systems in India; therefore even infections and diseases that have been under control elsewhere remain prevalent in the country, but are also under-diagnosed and under-reported. Without improving microbiological expertise and application as well as epidemiological skills and practices, emerging and re-emerging diseases may not be recognised, identified or intercepted in their early stages.},

	abstract = {Helminth identification and egg counts were performed in 316 fecal samples during 4 years in 199 golden lion tamarins (GLTs), Leontopithecus rosalia, from two Brazilian conservation units. Tamarin sex and age, area of occurrence and helminth co-infection were tested as potential factors that could affect helminth prevalence and egg shedding in host individuals. Three nematodes species were found at low prevalences but not in both conservation units: Ancylostomatidae (12\%), Ascarididae (1\%) and Tripanoxyuris minutus, an Oxyuridae (4\%). Three other species had high prevalences and were found in both conservation units: one acanthocephalan, Oncicola sp. (30\%), and two nematodes, Spiruridae (24\%), and Trichostrongylidae (31\%). These three latter helminths had distinct prevalences between the conservation units, probably due to differences in availability of helminth infective stages in each area. Prevalences were greater in females for all helminth species; this was especially the case for Oncicola sp. Sex and age differences in helminth prevalence may be associated with changes in sexual steroid levels that accompany age and reproductive status. Frequency of simultaneous infections by the two helminths considered most pathogenic (Oncicola and Trichostrongylidae) were statistically lower than expected; this may be related to: (i) higher tamarin death rate caused by the association; (ii) differences in exposure to helminth infective stages in the various areas of occurrence; (iii) and competition between these helminth species. All helminth species followed a negative binomial distribution, with stronger clumping occurring in Trichostrongylidae and in female GLTs. Distinct transmission strategies of Oncicola sp. and Spiruridae, in contrast with Trichostrongylidae, may partially explain the different clumping levels of these helminths in GLTs. Mean fecal egg counts of all helminths were not different between GLT sexes, ages or areas of occurrence. The three most common helminth species may be a threat to isolated or dense GLT populations.

Rodents were collected to determine the prevalence of rodent-borne diseases at a U.S. military installation in an urban environment. A total of 1,750 rodents representing three species was collected by using baited live traps (Tomahawk), glue boards, and poison baits (dead rodents observed but not assayed). The Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus (99.8\%), accounted for nearly all of the rodents captured/observed. Only three roof rats, Rattus rattus (0.2\%), and one house mouse, Mus musculus ({\textbackslash}textless0.1\%), were collected. R. norvegicus rats were the only rodents that were serologically positive for SEO virus (9.6\%), scrub typhus (2.8\%), murine typhus (3.8\%), and leptospirosis (4.6\%). One of six rodents that were positive for SEO virus by immunofluorescent antibody test was positive for SEO virus antigen by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Infection rates for SEO virus, scrub typhus, murine typhus, and leptospirosis varied annually. Rodents were captured from 228 (20.7\%) of 1,104 total buildings in Yongsan Garrison. The Yongsan commissary had the highest annual infestation rate (22 rodents per year), followed by Commisky's Club (18 rodents per year). Annual infestation rates were high for food service facilities, which often store perishable food products outdoors for short periods of time, attracting rodent populations; refuse from these facilities provides harborage and food for rodents. The effect of rodent populations outside the boundary of Yongsan Garrison was not determined.},

	abstract = {Wild and feral medium-sized mammals were live trapped at two natural protected areas within the Mexico City limits to determine antibody prevalence for the most common infectious diseases (rabies, toxoplasmosis, and canine parvovirus) in dogs and cats. Mammals were trapped during the dry (March-April) and rainy seasons (July-August) of 1996 and 1997. A total of 68 individuals were captured, representing 8 species: opossums (Didelphis virginiana), ringtails (Bassariscus astutus), spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), weasels (Mustela frenata), rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus), Mexican gray squirrels (Sciurus aureogaster), feral cats (Felis catus), and feral dogs (Canis familiaris). There was marked seroprevalence for parvovirus (86.6\%) and lower seroprevalences for both toxoplasma (23.9\%) and rabies (17.9\%). There were no significant prevalence differences among mammals in both protected areas, which were of contrasting size and isolation (i.e., small and isolated versus large and nonisolated). We suggest that high seroprevalence of these three infectious agents in wild mammals is a result of the high densities of feral dogs and cats in the two areas sampled. Feral dogs are able to maintain the infectious agents in these localities regardless of the protected area size and isolation. However, the native mammals of the small and isolated reserve are more vulnerable to infectious diseases because of small population size and genetic bottlenecks. Our results indicate that natural areas in and around Mexico City are a refugium for latent infectious agents, several of which are zoonotic. These findings suggest that conservation measures, such as eradication of feral mammals and vaccination programs, in the protected areas and surrounding areas could be beneficial.},

A total of 1 051 ( 384, 302, and 365, respectively) blood sera were collected from hares during autumn hunting events and examined for tularaemia, brucellosis and leptospirosis in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Antibodies were found in 6.5, 1.6 and 7.5\% of cases, respectively. Antibodies against Francisella tularensis, Brucella suis and leptospires were found in 7.9, 1.7 and 7.7\% of females and 4.5, 1.4 and 7.9\% of males, respectively. Higher seroprevalence of tularaemia was found in females ( P = 0.05). Brucellosis was more prevalent in adult animals compared to subadult ones ( P = 0.05). Only the L. grippotyphosa serotype was found and the titres mostly ranged from 100 to 400 ( 89.9\%). Higher titres from 800 to 3 200 were found in the remaining 10.1\% of the examined European brown hare sera. Antibodies against F. tularensis as well as B. suis were most frequent in low titres of 10 to 80. Higher titres were only exceptional. Confirming that hares are susceptible to various zoonotic agents, it is necessary to be careful when handling the animals killed. On the other hand, blood sera from hares may be used to survey the occurrence of natural nidi of zoonoses in hunting grounds.},

Design Retrospective study from January 1995 to August 1999. Procedure Case records were reviewed for age, breed, sex, month of submission, geographical location and presenting clinical signs in 40 dogs with titres of {\textbackslash}textgreater= 200 for leptospirosis by the microscopic agglutination test. A biochemistry panel and complete blood count were performed on 18 dogs. Results Canine leptospirosis occurred most frequently during the summer and autumn particularly in the 'wet' tropical coastal areas of Mackay and Cairns. Fewer cases were seen in the Atherton Tablelands and 'dry' tropics around Townsville. Young and male dogs were more commonly affected. Most cases were caused by L australis (80\%) and L zanoni (15\%) with individual cases of L hardjo and L copenhageni. All dogs showed a distinctive multiorgan disease pattern including renal failure and cholestatic hepatopathy. Presenting clinical signs were related to these disease syndromes and included jaundice, vomiting, lethargy, inappetence, dehydration, pyrexia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Just over 50\% of the dogs in the present study failed to recover. Clinical biochemical changes indicative of renal failure and cholestasis were significantly less severe in dogs that recovered compared with dogs that did not survive. Conclusions Clinical pathology testing should be performed on all dogs presented for illness in the endemic areas so as to help make a presumptive diagnosis and assist in determining the prognosis as soon as possible. The presumptive diagnosis should be confirmed serologically.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is a severe spirochetal zoonosis in the world. It is considered an occupational disease of persons engaged in agriculture, sewage works, forestry, and animal slaughtering. A study was conducted with an objective of assessing the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among the high-risk groups of Andaman Islands. A total of 611 sera samples from different high-risk populations were collected and tested by microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Genetic characterization of the isolate was done by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting, and serological characterization was done using monoclonal antibody technique. Antibodies to leptospires were detected in 322 samples giving an overall seroprevalence of 52.7\%. The seroprevalence was highest among agriculture workers (62.5\%) followed by sewage workers (39.4\%), animal handlers (37.5\%), forest workers (27.3\%), and butchers (30.0\%). Seroprevalence among control population was 14.7\%, which was comparatively less than that of the high-risk population groups. Subject sera were most commonly reacted with organisms of the serogroup Grippotyphosa followed by Australis, and the pattern was similar in control group. Four leptospires were isolated from agriculture workers who were admitted to the public health center (PHQ with complaints of fever and body ache. Human isolates were compared with two rodent (Rattus norvegicus) isolates from the same area of agriculture workers to get initial information about the transmission cycle of leptospirosis in the study community. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting pattern of the strains recovered from the rodents and human patients were identified as belonged to genomo-species Leptospira interrogans. The antigenic characterization of the strains recovered from them belonged to serovar Valbuzzi of serogroup Grippotyphosa. The study showed that people engaged in high-risk activities such as agriculture, sewage cleaning, animal handling, animal slaughtering, and forestry are frequently exposed to leptospirosis, and hence control strategies targeting these populations could be more effective.},

Waterborne disease agents, such as Giardia cysts and Cryposporidium oocysts have been positively correlated with rainfall. El Nino-related extreme weather conditions can have a significant impact on vector- and water-borne diseases. The linkages between weather, terrestrial ecology and human health have been discovered for some diseases, such as rodent-borne hantavirus. Marine ecology also plays a role in determining human health risks, such as from cholera, and other enteric pathogens. Deforestation and ensuing changes in landuse, human settlement, commercial development, road construction, and water control systems singly, and in combination have been accompanied by increases in or emergence of diseases like malaria and schistosomiasis in some regions of the world. Long-term climate change may increase the frequency of heat waves and potentially air pollution episodes, increase the number of extreme weather events, cause coastal flooding and salination of fresh water aquifers, and displace coastal settlements. Ultimately, a two-pronged approach (empirical and modeling studies) is required to better understand these linkages between climatological and ecological change as determinants of disease.},

	abstract = {The role of bats as potential sources of transmission to humans or as maintenance hosts of leptospires is poorly understood. We quantified the prevalence of leptospiral colonization in bats in the Peruvian Amazon in the vicinity of Iquitos, an area of high biologic diversity. Of 589 analyzed bats, culture (3 of 589) and molecular evidence (20 of 589) of leptospiral colonization was found in the kidneys, yielding an overall colonization rate of 3.4\%. Infection rates differed with habitat and location, and among different bat species. Bayesian analysis was used to infer phylogenic relationships of leptospiral 16S ribosomal DNA sequences. Tree topologies were consistent with groupings based on DNA-DNA hybridization studies. A diverse group of leptospires was found in peri-Iquitos bat populations including Leptospira interrogans (5 clones), L. kirschneri (1), L. borgpetersenii (4), L. fainei (1), and two previously undescribed leptospiral species (8). Although L. kirschenri and L. interrogans have been previously isolated from bats, this report is the first to describe L. borgpetersenii and L. fainei infection of bats. A wild animal reservoir of L. fainei has not been previously described. The detection in bats of the L. interrogans serovar Icterohemorrhagiae, a leptospire typically maintained by peridomestic rats, suggests a rodent-bat infection cycle. Bats in Iquitos maintain a genetically diverse group of leptospires. These results provide a solid basis for pursuing molecular epidemiologic studies of bat-associated Leptospira, a potentially new epidemiologic reservoir of transmission of leptospirosis to humans.},

Individual cards were sealed in a protective foil to secure stability of the dried reagent and to obtain a test in a single assay format. The latex agglutination assay is simply performed by suspending the dried latex reagent in a drop of serum and looking for macroscopic agglutination of the latex beads by visual inspection. Results are obtained within 30 s after mixing the sample with the test reagent. The sensitivity of the assay was determined to be 89.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 76-96) for the initial serum samples collected from patients with culture-confirmed brucellosis and the specificity is 98.2\% (95\% CI, 96-99). The assay is ideal for use as a field test in remote areas and as point-of-care test in hospitals and health care centers that lack the expertise and facilities to perform the more demanding classic serologic tests.

The 6 countries which have reported human cases of the disease as recently as 1994 are Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zaire and Zimbabwe. Natural foci of the infection remain in others. However, in addition to plague, other infections and human diseases with rodent reservoirs account for a great deal of morbidity and mortality in Africa though little actual data are available on the number of cases. The rodent-borne infections include the virus diseases Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, and, possibly Rift Valley fever. Bacterial infections include brucellosis, leptospirosis, plague, rat-bite fever, tick-borne relapsing fever and tularemia. Rickettsial infections are common and include murine typhus, tick typhus, Q-fever. There are also several helminthic infections which may be passed from rodents to man and the most important of these is schistosomiasis. One must take into account the fact that serious rodent depredations on man's foodstuffs can also lead to malnutrition.},

Rattus rattus was the most abundant rodent caught and yielded the majority of the Leptospira isolates. The prevalence of leptospiral titres at a serum dilution of 1 :100, was 62.5 \% for the rodents and 82\% for the volunteer blood donors. The most common titres in both the rodents and humans were to antigens from the Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pyrogenes and Grippotyphosa serogroups.

Evidence of exposure to leptospirosis was detected in 36\% of raccoons tested; icterohemorrhagiae was the predominant reactive serovar in these animals. Sera from 13\% of skunks showed evidence of exposure to serovar grippotyphosa. One squirrel exhibited high antibody titers to serovars grippotyphosa and canicola. All 28 opossums examined tested negative to the five Leptospira serovars. Results from this serosurvey suggest that common peridomestic wildlife species should be considered as potential sources of leptospirosis to dogs and humans in Connecticut.

	abstract = {There is an urgent need for improved diagnosis of leptospirosis, an emerging infectious disease which imparts a large disease burden in developing countries. We evaluated the use of Leptospira immunoglobulin (Ig)-like (Lig) proteins as a serodiagnostic marker for leptospirosis. Lig proteins have bacterial immunoglobulin-like (Big) tandem repeat domains, a moiety found in virulence factors in other pathogens. Sera from patients identified during urban outbreaks in Brazil reacted strongly with immunoblots of a recombinant fragment comprised of the second to sixth Big domains of LigB from L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni, the principal agent for transmission in this setting. Furthermore, the sera recognized an analogous LigB fragment derived from L. kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa, a pathogenic serovar which is not endemic to the study area. The immunoblot assay detected anti-LigB IgM antibodies in sera from 92\% (95\% confidence interval, 85 to 96\%) of patients during acute-phase leptospirosis. The assay had a sensitivity of 81\% for sera from patients with less than 7 days of illness. Anti-LigB antibodies were found in sera from 57\% of the patients who did not have detectable anti-whole-Leptospira responses as detected by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microagglutination test. The specificities of the assay were 93 to 100\% and 90 to 97\% among sera from healthy individuals and patients with diseases that have clinical presentations that overlap with those of leptospirosis, respectively. These findings indicate that the antibody response to this putative virulence determinant is a sensitive and specific marker for acute infection. The use of this marker may aid the prompt and timely diagnosis required to reduce the high mortality associated with severe forms of the disease.},

Our aim was to analyse all reliable data collected at the Institut Pasteur from 1920 to 2003 to evaluate more precisely the evolution of the incidence of leptospirosis in France. Methods: The passive surveillance system used as early as 1920 allows the evaluation of teptospirosis incidence. Serological results inferred from the microagglutination procedure were used to evaluate variation in the incidence of the disease and the evolution of the Leptospira serogroups involved in the human disease. Results: No significant variation either in the number of leptospirosis cases or in the incidence of the disease was observed. However, the period of the 1970s was characterized by a rather tow incidence. The weather plays a major role by modifying fresh water abundance, rodent populations and human behaviour. However the weather's influence is not the sole factor involved in the incidence rate. No cyclic variation was evident. Conclusion: Although France has the highest incidence of teptospirosis in Europe, the analysis of serological data collected over 66 years has allowed us to conclude that in France, the incidence is slowly decreasing.(c) 2005 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

From September 2003 to December 2005, 263 leptospirosis suspect patients were recruited by public practitioners on 11 Pacific islands, using the WHO case definition. Diagnosis was confirmed using a three-level serology algorithm and a regional laboratory network. Sixty-nine leptospirosis cases were identified from seven islands: Futuna, Raiatea and the Marquesas Islands where outbreaks were apparent, and Vanuatu, Fiji, Palau and Wallis where sporadic cases indicated at least the presence of the disease. Most patients were men aged 17-40 years. The infection appeared to occur during the course of normal daily activities more often than following specific professional exposure. The dominant presumptive serogroups were Icterohaemorrhagiae and Australis, highly suggestive of a rodent reservoir. This study confirms the widespread presence of leptospirosis in the Pacific region. It should help in the implementation of local leptospirosis control plans and highlights the role of on-site laboratory confirmation. (C) 2007 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

Kidneys from 118 rodents were cultured and serum samples from 201 were processed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Logistic regression was performed with ELISA seropositivity as the dependent variable and rodent characteristics were offered as independent variables. Overall prevalence of positive ELISA reactions was 42\% (84/201). In urban areas, leptospiral isolations belonged to the Ballum serogroup; in natural corridors, they belonged to the Icterohaemorragiae serogroup. M. musculus (house mouse) was the most-frequently captured species and the predominant one in urban areas. Most isolates and seropositivity, results were obtained on this species. Adults and subadults had higher seroprevalences than juvenile rodents. Oligoryzomys flavescens had higher seroprevalence than Akodon azarae, Mus musculus, Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus.

	abstract = {The Muridae rodent community of Guadeloupe and Martinique (French West Indies) includes 3 alien species: the Ship Rat (Rattus rattus), the Norwegian Rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the House Mouse (Mus musculus). A 26,740 trap-night effort conducted under standardized sampling methods showed a strong heterogeneity of the species frequency distribution among 4 agricultural ecosystems (sugar cane, banana, cassava and watermelon) and 3 "natural" ones (tropical rain forest and islands or islets covered either totally or partially by a dry vegetation). A second step of the analysis conducted at a smaller space scale, from the surrounding ecosystems of the cultivated areas to the inside of these ones, gave the same result. The House Mouse constituted the majority of the captures in the agricultural ecosystems (56\% for the total and 84\% for sugar cane specifically). This species is well represented inside the cultivated area and poorly outside. The Ship Rat is well represented in the "savannah" and "thorn-scrub", and in tropical rain forest, habitats that surround sugar cane and banana fields respectively. Statistically less numerous than the others, the Norwegian Rat was nevertheless well represented in the cultivated area devoted to watermelon and cassava, and concentrated in the field margins. The build-up and the optimisation of strategies for controlling the alien rodents in tropical islands are discussed in relation to these results. The build-up of sampling strategies to evaluate epidemiological and environmental risks due to these alien rodents is also discussed. This last discussion was done in the light of a new result showing that 57\% of sampled Guadeloupe House Mice hosted Leptospira interrogans on their kidneys.},

	abstract = {A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for diagnosing leptospirosis and differentiating pathogenic and saprophytic leptospires. Specific primers were designed to amplify 23S rDNA from pathogenic Leptospira and saprophytic Leptospira spp. PCR products from 27 pathogenic and 5 (including 1 intermediate) saprophytic serovars were 615 and 316 base pairs (bp), respectively. After the restriction enzyme's digestion of PCR products, the fragments by Sac1 of pathogenic serovars and by PstI of saprophytic serovars were 339 and 276 bp and 202 and 114 bp, respectively. The PCR primers enabled amplification of DNA from L. melveri serovar Ranarum as a pathogenic Leptospira spp. The PCR assay could detect 1 to 2 cells of leptospires and not amplify DNA from other 18 bacterial species. The sensitivity and specificity of this PCR in rat kidney, using isolation as gold standard, were 98.6\% and 100\%, respectively. The most appropriate sample preparation of blood for detecting DNA was buffy coat. Among the sample preparations from 7 laboratory-confirmed leptospirosis cases, leptospiral DNA was detected in all 7 buffy coat preparations, whereas leptospiral DNA was detected in only 3 plasma or serum samples. The PCR assay may be useful as a diagnostic tool for leptospirosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Completion of the genomic sequences of leptospires has facilitated advances in diagnosis and prevention of the disease, and yielded insight into its pathogenesis. This article reviews this research, emphasizing recent progress. Recent findings Leptospirosis is caused by a group of highly invasive spiral bacteria (spirochetes) that can infect both people and animals. Spirochetes can survive in the environment and host, and therefore outer membrane and secretory proteins that interact with the host are of considerable interest in leptospire research. The genetic approach to studying pathogenesis is hindered by fastidious growth of pathogenic leptospires. Integrated genomic and proteomic approaches, however, have yielded enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Furthermore, studies of innate immune response to the organism have enhanced our understanding of host susceptibility and resistance to infection. In-silico analysis and high-throughput cloning and expression have had major impacts on efforts to develop vaccine candidates and diagnostic reagents. Summary In the future, we must effectively utilize the wealth of genetic information to combat the disease. More studies into genetics, immune mechanisms that may be exploited to prevent leptospirosis, and pathogenesis of the disease are necessary.},

Current leptospiral research is focussed on the identification of the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of the organism that could be used in developing diagnostic assays for leptospirosis. Methods: The Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola was grown in EMJH medium and the cells were subjected to sarcosyl detergent treatment. The sarcosyl soluble (SS) and sarcosyl insoluble (SI) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to deduce their protein profile and identifying various immunodominant antigens. Results: The protein profile of SS fractions indicated the presence of three major bands of 41, 32 and 25 kDa and minor bands of 85 and 46 kDa. The SI fraction in serovar Canicola revealed the presence of 112, 93, 77, 43, 36, 29 and 22.5 kDa as major bands and minor bands of 102 and 53 kDa. In immunoblotting, the SS proteins of 41, 32 and 25 kDa and SI proteins of 112, 77, 36 and 22.5 kDa were detected to be major immunogenic proteins. Interpretation \& conclusion: In our study immunogenic proteins were extracted from SS and SI fractions and OMPs were similar to those reported in other pathogenic Leptospira strains. These OMPs being unique to all the pathogenic leptospires, can be targeted for diagnostic purpose. Further analysis of the cellular location and expression of leptospiral proteins will be useful in the annotation of genomic sequence data and in providing insight into the biology of Leptospira cells.},

Complete genome sequencing of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni and comparative analysis with the available Leptospira interrogans serovar Lai genome reveal that despite overall genetic similarity there are significant structural differences, including a large chromosomal inversion and extensive variation in the number and distribution of insertion sequence elements. Genome sequence analysis elucidates many of the novel aspects of leptospiral physiology relating to energy metabolism, oxygen tolerance, two-component signal transduction systems, and mechanisms of pathogenesis. A broad array of transcriptional regulation proteins and two new families of afimbrial adhesins which contribute to host tissue colonization in the early steps of infection were identified. Differences in genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide 0 side chains between the Copenhageni and Lai serovars were identified, offering an important starting point for the elucidation of the organism's complex polysaccharide surface antigens. Differences in adhesins and in lipopolysaccharide might be associated with the adaptation of serovars Copenhageni and Lai to different animal hosts. Hundreds of genes encoding surface-exposed lipoproteins and transmembrane outer membrane proteins were identified as candidates for development of vaccines for the prevention of leptospirosis.},

	abstract = {Tularemia is a disease caused by several subspecies of Francisella tularensis, although the severity of the disease varies greatly from subspecies to subspecies. Currently, there are four recognized subspecies (tularensis, holarctica, mediasiatica, and novicida), in addition to a second Francisella species, F. philondragia. It is clear from molecular sampling of the environment that these human pathogens are a mere fraction of the Francisella diversity. Taxonomic nomenclature is now being based upon several DNA-sequence-based approaches and this advance provides for robust phylogenetic models that are guiding the systematics of this genus. This in turn allows for better molecular epidemiological investigations and more precise ecological analysis. Tularemia ecology is still only partially understood, with many knowledge gaps about the disease reservoir and vectors. Molecular analysis has identified a major population split within E tularensis subsp. tularensis that points toward distinctive ecological adaptations, vectors, and host species. Current medical practice does not rely upon subspecies or subpopulation identification, although this information may have predictive value for clinical outcome, especially in the United States. Combined molecular and epidemiological analyses suggest that the population split in E tularensis subsp. tularensis matches two distinct human diseases in the United States with different mortality rates. DNA-sequence-based typing of E tularensis subsp. holarctica from tularemia outbreaks in Europe and the United States proves regional identity among isolates and also demonstrates that this subspecies successfully disseminated worldwide in recent evolutionary time.},

Absence of such amplicons in DNA extracted from Pasteurella, Campylobacter and Brucella confirmed the specificity of the primers. Serum and tissue samples collected from cattle, buffaloes and experimentally infected guinea pigs and calves were subjected to PCR using above primers as well as conventionally used primers G1/G2.

We examined risk factors associated with the risk of testing seropositive to three L. interrogans serovars (L. icterohaemorrhagiae, L. grippotyphosa, and L. canicola) in the horses of New York State, in order to understand the epidemiology of the disease and suggest strategies to control and prevent equine leptospirosis. To carry out this study, blood samples were collected from a random sample of 2551 horses and tested for the presence of antibodies to the above serovars using the microscopic agglutination test. Samples with a titer \$100 were considered positive. Clinical and demographic data were collected on each horse, the farms' management practices and ecology. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a multivariate indexing system and to identify factors significantly associated with the risk of leptospirosis. Four indices were developed based on the possible sources of exposure: rodent exposure index; wildlife exposure index; soil and water index; and management index. The soil and water index was significantly associated with the risk of exposure to all three serovars. Management was positively associated with L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. canicola. Density of horses turned out together was positively associated with the risk of exposure to L. grippotyphosa, We concluded that indirect exposure of horses to L. interrogans through contaminated soil and water appears to be significantly associated with the risk of exposure to all three serovars. Management appears to play an important role in the exposure to L, interrogans. Modification of management practices might reduce the horses' risk of exposure and hopefully minimize the human hazards. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of infectious bovine abortion and to identify some of its causes, specifically brucellosis, leptospirosis, bovine viral diarrhea, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and neosporosis. The study was carried out in a dairy herd in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, between September 2002 and March 2003. At the beginning of the study, blood samples were taken from a random 33\% of the 300 lactating or pregnant cows; antibodies against Leptospira interrogans were the most commonly identified, in 91\% of the 99 samples. Blood samples were also taken 14 to 28 d after the 26 subsequent abortions in the herd in the 6-mo study period, as well as from 22 cows that had not aborted within 5 d after the abortions in the other group. Seroconversion was most frequent for L. hardjo, occurring in 8 (67\%) of the 12 dams that aborted after the initial serologic sampling and for which paired serum samples were therefore available. Of the 16 collected fetuses, 10 had histologic lesions suggesting infection in various organs, the features correlating with the serologic results for the dams in 7 cases. Thus, the abortions may have been caused by more than 1 infectious agent.},

A new diagnostic test is therefore required for an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of leptospirosis. We applied immunoproteomics to define potential immunogens from five serovars of Leptospira reference strains. A leptospiral whole cell lysate from each serovar was used as the antigen to react with IgG and IgM in the sera from four patients with a positive MAT. Sera from four non-leptospirosis patients with a negative MAT were pooled and used as the negative control. 2-D Western blot analysis showed that the degree of immunoreactivity corresponded with the MAT titers. No immunoreactive spots were detected when the pooled control sera were used. A total of 24 protein spots immunoreacted with IgM and/or IgG from patients with leptospirosis. These immunoreactive proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and were classified into five groups, including flagellar proteins, chaperones/heat shock proteins, transport proteins, metabolic enzymes, and hypothetical proteins. More immunoreactive spots were detected with antihuman IgG in the sera of all patients and with all the serovars of leptospires used. Some of the identified proteins immunoreacted only with IgG, whereas the others were detectable with both IgM and IgG. Among the immunoreactive proteins identified, FlaB proteins (flagellin and flagellar core protein) have been shown to have a potential role in clinical diagnostics and vaccine development. These data underscore the significant impact of immunoproteomics in clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Diseases such as plague, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever, transmitted between humans by blood-feeding arthropods, were once common in the United States. Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behavior, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behavior, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year. But demographic and sociologic factors also play a critical role in determining disease incidence, and it is unlikely that these diseases will cause major epidemics in the United States if the public health infrastructure is maintained and improved.},

Feral rats were trapped at sites throughout Barbados during two six month surveys: from October to March 1986/87 and from October to March 1994/95. During the first survey, 63 rats were trapped, of which 26 (41\%) were identified as Rattus rattus and 37 (59\%) as Rattus norvegicus. In the second study, 100 rats were napped, of which R. rattus comprised 24\% (24) and R norvegicus 76\% (76). Cultures of blood, urine and kidney were made in EMJH medium. Leptospires were isolated from 12/63 (19\%) and from 16/100 (16\%) of the rats during 1986/87 and 1994/95, respectively, 27/28 isolates were recovered from the kidneys or urine or both, while only one isolate was recovered from the blood. During the first study isolates were identified as serovars copenhageni (II) and arborea (I), while in the second study, serovars copenhageni (9), arborea (5) and bim (I) were identified; one isolate was lost before it could be identified. In the first study antibodies were defected by microscopic agglutination at a titre of greater than or equal to 100 in 26/62 (42\%) of rats tested while in the second survey, 5/100 (5\%) of rats had similar titres. In two surveys, conducted eight years apart, we confirmed that rats in Barbados are commonly infected with leptospires, and that viable organisms are found in the kidneys and urine, evidence of chronic infection and thus excretion of leptospires in rodent urine. Moreover, the predominant serovar isolated was copenhageni, of which Rattus spp, are the worldwide reservoir. There was little evidence that rats act as a reservoir for the serovar bim, the most common cause of human leptospirosis in Barbados.},

	volume = {116},
	abstract = {Many host-parasite models assume that transmission increases linearly with host population density ('density-dependent transmission'), but various alternative transmission functions have been proposed in an effort to capture the complexity of real biological systems. The most common alternative (usually applied to sexually transmitted parasites) assumes instead that the rate at which hosts contact one another is independent of population density, leading to 'frequency-dependent' transmission. This straight-forward distinction generates fundamentally different dynamics (e.g. deterministic, parasite-driven extinction with frequency- but not density-dependence). Here, we consider the situation where transmission occurs through two different types of contact, one of which is density-dependent (e.g. social contacts), the other density-independent (e.g. sexual contacts). Drawing on a range of biological examples, we propose that this type of contact structure may be widespread in natural populations. When our model is characterized mainly by density-dependent transmission, we find that allowing even small amounts of transmission to occur through density-independent contacts leads to the possibility of deterministic, parasite-driven extinction (and lowers the threshold for parasite persistence). Contrastingly, allowing some density-dependent transmission to occur in a model characterized mainly by density-independent contacts (i.e. by frequency-dependent transmission) does not affect the extinction threshold, but does increase the likelihood of parasite persistence. The idea that directly transmitted parasites exploit different types of host contact is not new, but here we show that the impact on dynamics can be fundamental even in the simplest cases. For example, in systems where density-dependent transmission is normally assumed de facto, we show that parasite-driven extinction can occur if a small amount of transmission occurs through density-independent contacts. Many empirical studies are still guided by the traditional density/frequency dichotomy, but our combined transmission function may provide a better model for systems in which both types of transmission occur.},

In October 2000, a rice mill workers who had fever and jaundice, tested positive in leptospiral IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microbiological and serological investigations were performed on the patient, a sample population of the rice mill workers, and the animal and rodent populations living in the same premises. Leptospira was isolated from the patient about 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms when he had recovered from illness following a course of doxycycline. The isolate was serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae of serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae. The patient also showed a fourfold rise in titers in microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and IgG ELISA. The rice mill workers had a seroprevalence rate of 68.3\%, which was significantly higher than that among a control group consisting of persons engaged in other occupations. Serological studies conducted among cattle, dogs, cats, and rats showed seroprevalence rates of 52.9\%, 50.0\%, 66.6\%, and 52.1\%, respectively. Leptospires were isolated from two rats, but the isolates were lost during subculturing and could not be characterized. The most predominant serogroup identified by MAT was Autumnalis for rice mill workers and all animal populations. The other serogroups that reacted in MAT were Icterohaemorrhagiae, Australis, Grippotyphosa, and Patoc. Although Australis and Grippotyphosa showed agglutination in the case of human samples, none of the animals had detectable titers to these serogroups. The rice mills of Salem, having large rodent populations, various animals living in close proximity, a wet environment, and unprotected exposure of the workers to the environment, constitutes an ideal setting for transmission of leptospirosis and could be an epidemiological niche of leptospirosis.},

Francisella strains with experimentally induced mutations in FPI genes are highly attenuated in virulence and show defects in intramacrophage growth. There is experimental evidence indicating that the regulation of most FPI genes is affected by the presence of the virulence regulator MgIA and by the concentration of iron in the growth medium. Although studies of mRNA expression show that essentially all FP1 genes are transcribed, only a handful of FPI-encoded proteins have been detected by biochemical methods. The cumulative biochemical and genetic data to date have not yet been able to ascribe a biochemical function to any of the FPI-encoded proteins. However, bioinformatics analysis suggests that some of the FPI-encoded proteins are part of a type VI secretion system.},

A total of 192 brushtail possum blood samples were collected from 136 individuals in sub-urban areas of metropolitan Sydney from November 2002 to November 2004. Sera were screened against a reference panel of 21 Leptospira spp. using the microscopic agglutination test. Leptospiral antibodies were detected in 9.6\% (13/136) of tested brushtail possums and represented two serovars; antibodies to Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo were most frequently identified (11/ 136). A representative of the exotic serogroup Ballum, most likely serovar Arborea, was found in two of 136 brushtail possums. Exposure to leptospirosis seemed to be associated with age, as older animals had a higher incidence, but there was no distinction in relation to gender. Antibody prevalence varied between the different sampling sites and seropositive animals were clustered and restricted to a few sites. These data support the possible role of brushtail possums as a maintenance host for Leptospira spp. in urban environments and also identified them as a previously unknown and potential source of serovar Arborea.},

	abstract = {Urban expansion often occurs on croplands. However, there is little scientific understanding of how global patterns of future urban expansion will affect the world’s cultivated areas. Here, we combine spatially explicit projections of urban expansion with datasets on global croplands and crop yields. Our results show that urban expansion will result in a 1.8–2.4\% loss of global croplands by 2030, with substantial regional disparities. About 80\% of global cropland loss from urban expansion will take place in Asia and Africa. In both Asia and Africa, much of the cropland that will be lost is more than twice as productive as national averages. Asia will experience the highest absolute loss in cropland, whereas African countries will experience the highest percentage loss of cropland. Globally, the croplands that are likely to be lost were responsible for 3–4\% of worldwide crop production in 2000. Urban expansion is expected to take place on cropland that is 1.77 times more productive than the global average. The loss of cropland is likely to be accompanied by other sustainability risks and threatens livelihoods, with diverging characteristics for different megaurban regions. Governance of urban area expansion thus emerges as a key area for securing livelihoods in the agrarian economies of the Global South.},

	abstract = {We investigated the association between fatal snakebite envenoming and agricultural work in Brazil, considering the effects of relevant covariables. A nested case–control study was performed using 1,119 fatal cases of snakebite envenoming among persons aged ³ 10 years, notiﬁed to the Brazilian ofﬁcial reporting system, from 2004 to 2015. As controls, 4,476 cases were randomly selected from the 115,723 nonfatal cases of snakebite, without missing data, that occurred in the same time period. The main predictor was occupation in the agriculture sector; the main outcome was death by snakebite envenoming. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the main association, controlling for the effects of relevant covariables. Fatal cases had a 20\% greater chance (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.00–1.39) of being among farmers than the controls. However, late (³ 6 hours) time to treatment (OR = 2.00; 95\% CI: 1.70–2.36); adequate antivenom with an insufﬁcient (OR = 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.04–1.50) or excessive (OR = 4.89; 95\% CI: 4.10–6.03) number of vials; inadequate antivenom and insufﬁcient or excessive number of vials (OR = 3.87; 95\% CI: 2.40–6.24); no use of antivenom (OR = 2.05; 95\% CI: 1.60–2.64); and age ³ 60 years (OR = 1.98; 95\% CI: 1.61–2.44) were more strongly associated with lethality. Lethality was 1.0\% in the period, being 0.47\% among those receiving early and adequate treatment. We concluded that in Brazil, fatal snakebite envenoming was associated with agricultural work, controlling for relevant covariates. However, quality of health care provided and greater age were much more strongly associated with lethality.},

The circumstances of dry bites and their clinical diagnosis are not well-explored in the literature, which may lead to ambiguity amongst treating personnel about whether antivenom is indicated or not. Here, the epidemiology and recorded history of dry bites are reviewed, and the clinical knowledge on the dry bite phenomenon is presented and discussed.

The availability of safe, single-dose, drug treatment regimens capable of suppressing microﬁlaremia to very low levels, along with improvements in techniques for diagnosing infection, has resulted in the targeting of this major mosquito-borne disease for global elimination. The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was launched in 2000 with the principal objective of breaking the cycles of transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia spp. through the application of annual mass drug administrations (MDAs) to entire at-risk populations. Although significant progress in initiating MDA programs in endemic countries has been made, emerging challenges to this approach have raised questions regarding the effectiveness of using MDA alone to eliminate LF without the inclusion of supplementary vector control. Here, we review advances in knowledge of vector ecology, vector-parasite relationships, and both empirical and theoretical evidence regarding vector management to assess the feasibility and strategic value of including vector control in the GPELF initiative to achieve the global elimination of LF.},

	abstract = {Most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) have complex life cycles and are challenging to control. The “2020 goals” of control and elimination as a public health programme for a number of NTDs are the subject of significant international efforts and investments. Beyond 2020 there will be a drive to maintain these gains and to push for true local elimination of transmission. However, these diseases are affected by variations in vectors, human demography, access to water and sanitation, access to interventions and local health systems. We therefore argue that there will be a need to develop local quantitative expertise to support elimination efforts. If available now, quantitative analyses would provide updated estimates of the burden of disease, assist in the design of locally appropriate control programmes, estimate the effectiveness of current interventions and support ‘real-time’ updates to local operations. Such quantitative tools are increasingly available at an international scale for NTDs, but are rarely tailored to local scenarios. Localised expertise not only provides an opportunity for more relevant analyses, but also has a greater chance of developing positive feedback between data collection and analysis by demonstrating the value of data. This is essential as rational program design relies on good quality data collection. It is also likely that if such infrastructure is provided for NTDs there will be an additional impact on the health system more broadly. Locally tailored quantitative analyses can help achieve sustainable and effective control of NTDs, but also underpin the development of local health care systems.},

	abstract = {A holy grail of conservation is to find simple but reliable measures of environmental change to guide management. For example, particular species or particular habitat attributes are often used as proxies for the abundance or diversity of a subset of other taxa. However, the efficacy of such kinds of species-based surrogates and habitat-based surrogates is rarely assessed, nor are different kinds of surrogates compared in terms of their relative effectiveness. We use 30-year datasets on arboreal marsupials and vegetation structure to quantify the effectiveness of: (1) the abundance of a particular species of arboreal marsupial as a species-based surrogate for other arboreal marsupial taxa, (2) hollow-bearing tree abundance as a habitat-based surrogate for arboreal marsupial abundance, and (3) a combination of species- and habitat-based surrogates. We also quantify the robustness of species-based and habitat-based surrogates over time. We then use the same approach to model overall species richness of arboreal marsupials. We show that a species-based surrogate can appear to be a valid surrogate until a habitat-based surrogate is co-examined, after which the effectiveness of the former is lost. The addition of a species-based surrogate to a habitat-based surrogate made little difference in explaining arboreal marsupial abundance, but altered the co-occurrence relationship between species. Hence, there was limited value in simultaneously using a combination of kinds of surrogates. The habitat-based surrogate also generally performed significantly better and was easier and less costly to gather than the species-based surrogate. We found that over 30 years of study, the relationships which underpinned the habitat-based surrogate generally remained positive but variable over time. Our work highlights why it is important to compare the effectiveness of different broad classes of surrogates and identify situations when either species- or habitat-based surrogates are likely to be superior.},

Most victims were males aged between 11 years and 50 years who had been bitten on their feet or ankles while walking at night close to their homes. There was local swelling in 276 (91\%) and local necrosis in 48 (16\%). Eleven (4\%) required amputation of ﬁngers or toes and 12 (4\%) received skin grafts. In 117 patients (39\%) blood incoagulability was ﬁrst detected between 15 min and 48 h after the bite, and in 116 of them this was present on admission to hospital. Spontaneous systemic bleeding was observed in 55 patients (18\%). Acute renal failure developed in 10\%, ﬁve of whom died to give an overall case fatality rate of 1.7\%. Thus, bites by hump-nosed pit vipers can cause debilitating local and fatal systemic envenoming. In Sri Lanka and southwestern India where bites by these snakes are common, the only available antivenoms (raised against cobra, krait, Russell’s viper and saw-scaled viper venoms) are ineffective and carry a high risk of reactions.},

Despite this, there have been no countrywide studies or national estimates of disease burden due to snake bites in Sri Lankan hospitals. We assessed the disease burden due to snake bite in our hospitals and estimated the frequency of admissions due to bites by different snake species. Sri Lanka was divided into four zones based on climate and topography. Hospital morbidity and mortality data, which are available on an administrative district basis, were collated for the four zones. A survey of opinion among specialist physicians (the Delphi technique) was used to estimate the proportion of bites by different species, and requirements for anti-venom (AV) and intensive care facilities for management of snake bites in hospitals in each of the four zones. A study of hospital admissions due to snake bites in seven selected hospitals was also performed to validate the opinion survey. There was a clear difference in the incidence of hospital admissions due to snake bites in the different zones. Estimates of hospital admissions due to bites by different species also varied considerably between zones. These trends corresponded to estimates of requirements of AV and other supportive health care. Health care planning using data based on environmental information, rather than merely on political boundaries, could lead to targeted distribution of AV and intensive care requirements to manage snake bites.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 ∘C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

Correlations between abundances and niche-centroid distances were mostly negative, as per expectations of niche theory and the abundant niche-centre relationship. The negative relationships were not distributed randomly among species: terrestrial, non-migratory, small-bodied, small-niche-breadth and restricted-range species had the strongest negative associations. Distances to niche centroids as estimated from correlational analyses of presence-only data thus offer a unique means by which to infer geographic abundance patterns, which otherwise are enormously difficult to characterise.},

However, empirical support for decreasing population abundance with increasing distance from geographic range or climatic niche centre (distance–abundance relationships) remains fairly weak. We examine over 1400 bird, mammal, ﬁsh and tree species to provide a thorough test of distance–abundance relationships, and their associations with species traits and phylogenetic relationships. We failed to detect consistent distance–abundance relationships, and found no association between distance–abundance slope and species traits or phylogenetic relatedness. Together, our analyses suggest that distance–abundance relationships may be rare, difﬁcult to detect, or are an oversimpliﬁcation of the complex biogeographical forces that determine species spatial abundance patterns.},

Yet, potency and the amount of venom available varies greatly across species, ranging from the seemingly harmless to those capable of killing vast numbers of potential prey. This variation is poorly understood, with comparative approaches confounded by the use of atypical prey species as models to measure venom potency. Here, we account for such confounding issues by incorporating the phylogenetic similarity between a snake’s diet and the species used to measure its potency. In a comparative analysis of 102 species we show that snake venom potency is generally prey-speciﬁc. We also show that venom yields are lower in species occupying three dimensional environments and increases with body size corresponding to metabolic rate, but faster than predicted from increases in prey size. These results underline the importance of physiological and environmental factors in the evolution of predator traits.},

Because human–rattlesnake interactions are often contingent on post-encounter, human-initiated contact, we categorized these interactions into discrete components: co-occurrence of rattlesnakes and humans, and the probability that a human detects the rattlesnake. We used occupancy models to examine correlates of human–rattlesnake co-occurrence and assumed human–rattlesnake encounter probability was synonymous with detection probability. Occupancy (i.e., proportion of sites occupied) was associated with rattlesnake habitat preference, and encounter probability was inﬂuenced by air temperature. Our results indicate that covariates associated with rattlesnake activity (e.g., air temperature) were the best predictors of encounters. This article illustrates the use of occupancy models for identifying spatial and temporal drivers of human–wildlife interactions. Our results will aid management actions and policies that maximize human safety and rattlesnake conservation.},

	abstract = {Background: Snake bite is a neglected public health problem in the world and one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in many areas, particularly in the rural tropics. It also poses substantial economic burdens on the snake bite victims due to treatment related expenditure and loss of productivity. An accurate estimate of the risk of snake bite is largely unknown for most countries in the developing world, especially South-East Asia.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We undertook a national epidemiological survey to determine the annual incidence density of snake bite among the rural Bangladeshi population. Information on frequency of snake bite and individuals’ length of stay in selected households over the preceding twelve months was rigorously collected from the respondents through an interviewer administered questionnaire. Point estimates and confidence intervals of the incidence density of snake bite, weighted and adjusted for the multi-stage cluster sampling design, were obtained. Out of 18,857 study participants, over one year a total of 98 snake bites, including one death were reported in rural Bangladesh. The estimated incidence density of snake bite is 623.4 / 100,000 person years (95\% C I 513.4–789.2 /100,000 person years). Biting occurs mostly when individuals are at work. The majority of the victims (71\%) receive snake bites to their lower extremities. Eightysix percent of the victims received some form of management within two hours of snake bite, although only three percent of the victims went directly to either a medical doctor or a hospital.
Conclusions/Significance: Incidence density of snake bite in rural Bangladesh is substantially higher than previously estimated. This is likely due to better ascertainment of the incidence through a population based survey. Poor access to health services increases snake bite related morbidity and mortality; therefore, effective public health actions are warranted.},

Results for OS and IMTM indicate that B. atrox is significantly less active during the dry season. The monthly number of snakes found with OS and brought to the IMTM were both correlated with rainfall and relative humidity, but not with temperature. Monthly number of individuals found with TCS did not differ from expectation and was correlated with rainfall but not with humidity or temperature. Encounter rate at night was much higher than by day. Most snakes found at night were hunting in a coiled posture, whereas most snakes found by day were moving. Juveniles were found more frequently on vegetation than adults. The higher incidence of snakebites by B. atrox in summer in the Manaus region may reflect this increase in activity. Unimodal seasonal activity and primarily nocturnal habits are widespread in Bothrops. Ontogenetic shift in microhabitat use is also common in semiarboreal lanceheads and may be related to food availability and perhaps a higher predation pressure at the ground level.},

The theoretically expected number of degrees of freedom for the modified t test with renewed modifications is compared with that computed on the basis of equation (2.9) of Clifford et al. (1989). The largest differences are observed for small numbers of locations and high autocorrelation, in particular when the latter is present with opposite sign in the two processes.

The global pandemic caused by the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis has decimated frog populations around the world. This decline has been called out as a potential catastrophe for amphibian species. What has been less explored are the impacts of amphibian declines on other members of their ecological communities. Using survey data collected over 13 years, Zipkin et al. looked at diversity and body condition of a tropical snake community after amphibians were decimated by chytridiomycosis. They found that the snake community was less diverse and most species were in decline, except for a few “winning” species.
Science, this issue p. 814
Biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates worldwide. Yet cascading effects of biodiversity loss on other taxa are largely unknown because baseline data are often unavailable. We document the collapse of a Neotropical snake community after the invasive fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis caused a chytridiomycosis epizootic leading to the catastrophic loss of amphibians, a food source for snakes. After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and data-deficient species.
The loss of amphibians caused by a fungal disease has decreased diversity and worsened body condition in a neotropical snake community.

	abstract = {Venomous snakes are among the main sources of mortality for humans in rural regions, especially in tropical countries. In this study, a meta-analysis of quantitative community ecology studies on snake assemblages throughout the world was conducted in order to evaluate variation in the frequency of occurrence of venomous species and venomous individuals by habitat and continent. A bibliographic search was done by consulting \&ldquo;Google Scholar\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;ISI Web of Knowledge\&rdquo;. In total, 24,200 results were obtained from our bibliographic search, out of which 60 independent studies reporting raw and analyzable quantitative data from 81 distinct snake communities were retained and used for analyses. A snow-ball procedure was also used to uncover additional studies to include in the analyses. We gathered data on a total of 30,537 snake individuals, with an average of almost 30\% of venomous individuals. The mean number of sympatric species was 19, whereas the mean number of sympatric venomous species was almost 5. Venomous snake species accounted for 24.4\% of the total species in each community\&mdash;almost the same as the overall percentage of venomous snake species known worldwide (about 24\%). The frequency of occurrence of venomous individuals did not differ significantly between tropical and temperate snake communities, and the same was true for the frequency of venomous species within each community. Thus, the greater number of snakebites in tropical countries is not due to there being more venomous snake species or individuals. The total number of species and the number of venomous species observed in each community were positively correlated, and there was a significant difference among continents in terms of the mean number of species in each community. Within communities, there were inter-continental and inter-habitat differences in both the percentage of venomous species and in the percentage of venomous individuals. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) revealed that the frequency of venomous species at a local scale depended only on the total number of species inhabiting a given site, whereas the frequency of venomous individuals within communities depended on both the total number of species and a habitat\&ndash;continent interaction. Our meta-analysis could enable the appropriate authorities/agencies to take the relative abundance of venomous species/individuals within snake assemblages into consideration for a better positioning of the first aid centers in locations where snake antivenoms should be available.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to understand the impacts of global climate change (GCC) on the distribution of dangerous venomous snakes and snakebite risk in Mozambique, as a contribution to the enhancement of public health policies and snake conservation. We modelled current and future distribution of all 13 dangerous snakes occurring in Mozambique using ecological niche models to assess the likely impacts of climate change estimated as the difference between lost and gained climatic suitable area per species. In addition, we developed a normalized index of snakebite risk based on species diversity and species-specific traits for each time slice. We then superimposed our index to data on human population density to identify areas most prone to this burden. Our findings suggest considerable future reduction in climatically suitable area for nine out of 13 species, with species experiencing a north-south range shift and high rates of species turnover in northern Mozambique. We also found that GCC might alter the spatial patterns of snakebite risk in the country, with considerable increase in the future, affecting most areas in central and southern regions. This finding suggests that GCC will be harmful to venomous snakes in Mozambique with potentially adverse effects on public health. As GCC might induce the approximation of snake climatic suitable areas to highly populated areas, efforts are needed to increase human knowledge of snakebite prevention measures and increase awareness of the relative safety and attacking behaviour associated with some of the snakes studied here ensuring reduction in snakebites and improving species conservation.},

A survey based on national health statistics was carried out in Ecuador to estimate the overall incidence and mortality due to snake bites. During the period 1998–2007, the average annual incidence and mortality was respectively 11 and 0.5 per 100 000 inhabitants. The at-risk population was represented mainly by males aged 10–54 years. Snake bite incidence increased during the rainy season and El Nin˜ o. According to one data source, the majority of snake bites occurred in the coastal region (56\%) compared with the Amazonian rainforest (11\%) and the highlands (33\%). This geographical variation in snake bite incidence may reﬂect the distribution of venomous snakes and human population densities and activities. This preliminary national survey on the incidence of the envenomings due to snake bite in Ecuador showed a stable incidence over the time period studied but was heterogeneous in the three geographical regions of Ecuador. The incidence and mortality were higher in the lowland humid regions where Bothrops species are abundant.},

	abstract = {Background Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health challenge that affects mostly economically deprived communities who inhabit tropical regions. In these regions, snakebite incidence data is not always reliable, and access to health care is scare and heterogeneous. Thus, addressing the problem of snakebite effectively requires an understanding of how spatial heterogeneity in snakebite is associated with human demographics and snakes’ distribution. Here, we use a mathematical model to address the determinants of spatial heterogeneity in snakebite and we estimate snakebite incidence in a tropical country such as Costa Rica.
Methods and findings We combined a mathematical model that follows the law of mass action, where the incidence is proportional to the exposed human population and the venomous snake population, with a spatiotemporal dataset of snakebite incidence (Data from year 1990 to 2007 for 193 districts) in Costa Rica. This country harbors one of the most dangerous venomous snakes, which is the Terciopelo (Bothrops asper, Garman, 1884). We estimated B. asper distribution using a maximum entropy algorithm, and its abundance was estimated based on field data. Then, the model was adjusted to the data using a lineal regression with the reported incidence. We found a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.66, p-value {\textless} 0.01) between our estimation and the reported incidence, suggesting the model has a good performance in estimating snakebite incidence.
Conclusions Our model underscores the importance of the synergistic effect of exposed population size and snake abundance on snakebite incidence. By combining information from venomous snakes’ natural history with census data from rural populations, we were able to estimate snakebite incidence in Costa Rica. The model was able to fit the incidence data at fine},

	abstract = {Small reserves are especially likely to lose species. Is that because the reserves are small, or because small reserves are located in especially adverse landscapes? It seems that the question has rarely, if ever, been asked. Data on reserve size and location in Africa, and calculations of local (within 50 km) mean human densities from available census records per province per country were the database here used to answer the question. IUCN grade I and II reserves in Africa are located across the range of human densities per country, including in regions of higher than average density. Furthermore reserve size correlates with local human density, such that small reserves are indeed significantly more likely than are large reserves to be located in regions of high human density (n = 169; P {\textless} 0.0001). However, while local human density correlates significantly with human-caused mortality of carnivores (the only taxon for which we had data), it does not correlate with detected extinctions in reserves in east Africa (the only region with available data). Rather, area of reserve is the main predictor. Nevertheless, abundant other evidence of the adverse effects of high human density on persistence of species and wilderness indicates that we need to take as a warning the findings reported here that small reserves occur in regions of high human density, and that human density correlates with human-caused mortality. They indicate that small reserves might face the double jeopardy of both their small size, and also their situation in especially hostile surroundings. In effect, small reserves are more isolated in more adverse habitat than current analyses in conservation biology, landscape ecology, or metapopulation analysis usually indicate.},

Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins that exert a wide range of toxic actions. The high variability in snake venom composition is responsible for the various clinical manifestations in envenomings, ranging from local tissue damage to potentially life-threatening systemic effects. Intravenous administration of antivenom is the only specific treatment to counteract envenoming. Analgesics, ventilator support, fluid therapy, haemodialysis and antibiotic therapy are also used. Novel therapeutic alternatives based on recombinant antibody technologies and new toxin inhibitors are being explored.

Understanding the short- and long-term impacts of these extreme events on large-bodied predators will provide insight into the spatial and temporal scales at which acute environmental disturbances in top-down processes may persist within and across ecosystems. Here, we use longterm studies of movements and age structure of an estuarine top predator — juvenile bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas — to identify the effects of an extreme ‘cold snap’ from 2 to 13 January 2010 over short (weeks) to intermediate (months) time scales. Juvenile bull sharks are typically yearround residents of the Shark River Estuary until they reach 3 to 5 yr of age. However, acoustic telemetry revealed that almost all sharks either permanently left the system or died during the cold snap. For 116 d after the cold snap, no sharks were detected in the system with telemetry or captured during longline sampling. Once sharks returned, both the size structure and abundance of the individuals present in the nursery had changed considerably. During 2010, individual longlines were 70\% less likely to capture any sharks, and catch rates on successful longlines were 40\% lower than during 2006−2009. Also, all sharks caught after the cold snap were young-of-theyear or neonates, suggesting that the majority of sharks in the estuary were new recruits and several cohorts had been largely lost from the nursery. The longer-term impacts of this change in bull shark abundance to the trophic dynamics of the estuary and the importance of episodic disturbances to bull shark population dynamics will require continued monitoring, but are of considerable interest because of the ecological roles of bull sharks within coastal estuaries and oceans.},

	abstract = {1. Search processes play an important role in physical, chemical and biological systems. In animal foraging, the search strategy predators should use to search optimally for prey is an enduring question. Some models demonstrate that when prey is sparsely distributed, an optimal search pattern is a specialised random walk known as a Lévy flight, whereas when prey is abundant, simple Brownian motion is sufficiently efficient. These predictions form part of what has been termed the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis (LFF) which states that as Lévy flights optimise random searches, movements approximated by optimal Lévy flights may have naturally evolved in organisms to enhance encounters with targets (e.g. prey) when knowledge of their locations is incomplete. 2. Whether free-ranging predators exhibit the movement patterns predicted in the LFF hypothesis in response to known prey types and distributions, however, has not been determined. We tested this using vertical and horizontal movement data from electronic tagging of an apex predator, the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias, across widely differing habitats reflecting different prey types. 3. Individual white sharks exhibited movement patterns that predicted well the prey types expected under the LFF hypothesis. Shark movements were best approximated by Brownian motion when hunting near abundant, predictable sources of prey (e.g. seal colonies, fish aggregations), whereas movements approximating truncated Lévy flights were present when searching for sparsely distributed or potentially difficult-to-detect prey in oceanic or shelf environments, respectively. 4. That movement patterns approximated by truncated Lévy flights and Brownian behaviour were present in the predicted prey fields indicates search strategies adopted by white sharks appear to be the most efficient ones for encountering prey in the habitats where such patterns are observed. This suggests that C. carcharias appears capable of exhibiting search patterns that are approximated as optimal in response to encountered changes in prey type and abundance, and across diverse marine habitats, from the surf zone to the deep ocean. 5. Our results provide some support for the LFF hypothesis. However, it is possible that the observed Lévy patterns of white sharks may not arise from an adaptive behaviour but could be an emergent property arising from simple, straight-line movements between complex (e.g. fractal) distributions of prey. Experimental studies are needed in vertebrates to test for the presence of Lévy behaviour patterns in the absence of complex prey distributions.},

Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDGlobal aquatic environments are changing profoundly as a result of human actions; consequently, so too are the ways in which organisms are distributing themselves through space and time. Our ability to predict organism and community responses to these alterations will be dependent on knowledge of animal movements, interactions, and how the physiological and environmental processes underlying them shape species distributions. These patterns and processes ultimately structure aquatic ecosystems and provide the wealth of ecosystem services upon which humans depend. Until recently, the vast size, opacity, and dynamic nature of the aquatic realm have impeded our efforts to understand these ecosystems. With rapid technological advancement over the past several decades, a suite of electronic tracking devices (e.g., acoustic and satellite transmitters) that can remotely monitor animals in these challenging environments are now available. Aquatic telemetry technology is rapidly accelerating our ability to observe animal behavior and distribution and, as a consequence, is fundamentally altering our understanding of the structure and function of global aquatic ecosystems. These advances provide the toolbox to define how future global aquatic management practices must evolve.
ADVANCESAquatic telemetry has emerged through technological advances in miniaturization, battery engineering, and software and hardware development, allowing the monitoring of organisms whose habitats range from the poles to the tropics and the photic zone to the abyssal depths. This is enabling the characterization of the horizontal and vertical movements of individuals, populations, and entire communities over scales of meters to tens of thousands of kilometers and over time frames of hours to years and even over the entire lifetimes of individuals. Electronic tags can now be equipped with sensors that measure ambient physical parameters (depth, temperature, conductivity, fluorescence), providing simultaneous monitoring of animals’ environments. By linking telemetry with biologgers (e.g., jaw-motion sensors), it is possible to monitor individual feeding events. In addition, other devices on instrumented animals can communicate with one another, providing insights into predator-prey interactions and social behavior. Coupling telemetry with minute nonlethal biopsy allows understanding of how trophic dynamics, population connectivity, and gene-level basis for organismal health and condition relate to movement. These advances are revolutionizing the scope and scales of questions that can be addressed on the causes and consequences of animal distribution and movement.
OUTLOOKAquatic animal telemetry has advanced rapidly, yet new challenges present themselves in coordination of monitoring across large-spatial scales (ocean basins), data sharing, and data assimilation. The continued advancement of aquatic telemetry lies in establishing and maintaining accessible and cost-effective infrastructure and in promoting multidisciplinary tagging approaches to maximize cost benefits. A united global network and centralized database will provide the mechanism for global telemetry data and will promote a transparent environment for data sharing that will, in turn, increase global communication, scope for collaboration, intellectual advancement, and funding opportunities. An overarching global network will realize the potential of telemetry, which is essential for advancing scientific knowledge and effectively managing globally shared aquatic resources and their ecosystems in the face of mounting human pressures and environmental change. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/348/6240/1255642/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Aquatic telemetry in action.A southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) (A) and a lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) (D) fitted with acoustic tags are detected and logged by moored receivers (D) or mobile receivers attached to opportunistic platforms or carried by large animals (C). A juvenile green turtle (Chelonia mydas) (B) fitted with a satellite tag is monitored in real time via orbiting satellites. A grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) “bioprobe” (C), fitted with intercommunicating acoustic and satellite transmitters, transmits and receives data on animal interactions and ocean conditions.
The distribution and interactions of aquatic organisms across space and time structure our marine, freshwater, and estuarine ecosystems. Over the past decade, technological advances in telemetry have transformed our ability to observe aquatic animal behavior and movement. These advances are now providing unprecedented ecological insights by connecting animal movements with measures of their physiology and environment. These developments are revolutionizing the scope and scale of questions that can be asked about the causes and consequences of movement and are redefining how we view and manage individuals, populations, and entire ecosystems. The next advance in aquatic telemetry will be the development of a global collaborative effort to facilitate infrastructure and data sharing and management over scales not previously possible.},

	abstract = {The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) Canada is an integrative seven-year research program initiated in 2010 with academic, government, and industry partners. The team makes use of novel biotelemetry (primarily acoustic telemetry curtains), biologging, and oceanographic technologies to better understand changing ocean dynamics and their impact on ocean ecosystems, animal movements, and ecology and the dynamics of marine animal populations, many of which are commercially important. The network is organized around three ocean arenas (i.e., the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific) where specific research projects will occur. However, all projects will contribute toward addressing a single unifying nationalscale question—what are the movements of continental shelf marine animals, how do these movements affect species interactions, and what are the consequences of environmental variability/change and human activities on these species’ distributions and abundance? Taxa that will be tracked include diadromous (e.g., salmon, eels, sturgeon) and marine (e.g., sharks, capelin, cod) fishes and a variety of marine mammals (e.g., grey seals, killer whales). Some of the common activities that occur in all arenas include measurements of oceanographic characteristics and variability at various spatial and temporal scales, movements of key species at several trophic levels, and use of key acoustic “bioprobes” (animals that carry tags that record locations visited, ocean conditions, and interactions with other tagged animals) and “roboprobes” (remotely controlled autonomous vehicles such as gliders that measure physical, biological, and chemical conditions) to complement measurements from fixed OTN acoustic telemetry curtains. Ultimately, scientific information generated will inform resource management, help formulate new socioeconomic policies, and provide some impetus to the reformulation of governance practices and legal standards.

A network of acoustic receivers was used to quantify the long-term movements of transmitter-equipped tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier Péron \& Lesueur, 1822 in the Main Hawaiian Islands. Tiger sharks were wide-ranging, swam between islands and patrolled up to 109 km of contiguous coastline. Visits to specific acoustic receiver sites were typically brief (mean duration 3.3 min), unpredictable and interspersed by absences of weeks, months or years. This pattern may be an optimal foraging strategy for capturing risk-averse prey. Tiger sharks may have to move on soon after arriving in an area because the element of surprise is quickly lost and potential prey become wary and difficult to catch. Juvenile tiger sharks were significantly wider-ranging and less frequently detected than mature females. Juveniles may be avoiding predation by larger individuals, or exploring to find suitable home ranges. Tiger sharks may also switch movement patterns and foraging strategies to take advantage of different prey types, restricting their movements to exploit seasonally abundant and naïve prey. Further empirical studies are required to directly link movement patterns with foraging.},

Here we compare movement, reef-fidelity, and ocean migration for tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, across the Coral Sea, with an emphasis on New Caledonia. Thirty-three tiger sharks (1.54 to 3.9 m total length) were tagged with passive acoustic transmitters and their localised movements monitored on receiver arrays in New Caledonia, the Chesterfield and Lord Howe Islands in the Coral Sea, and the east coast of Queensland, Australia. Satellite tags were also used to determine habitat use and movements among habitats across the Coral Sea. Sub-adults and one male adult tiger shark displayed year-round residency in the Chesterfields with two females tagged in the Chesterfields and detected on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, after 591 and 842 days respectively. In coastal barrier reefs, tiger sharks were transient at acoustic arrays and each individual demonstrated a unique pattern of occurrence. From 2009 to 2013, fourteen sharks with satellite and acoustic tags undertook wide-ranging movements up to 1114 km across the Coral Sea with eight detected back on acoustic arrays up to 405 days after being tagged. Tiger sharks dove 1136 m and utilised three-dimensional activity spaces averaged at 2360 km3. The Chesterfield Islands appear to be important habitat for sub-adults and adult male tiger sharks. Management strategies need to consider the wide-ranging movements of large (sub-adult and adult) male and female tiger sharks at the individual level, whereas fidelity to specific coastal reefs may be consistent across groups of individuals. Coastal barrier reef MPAs, however, only afford brief protection for large tiger sharks, therefore determining the importance of other oceanic Coral Sea reefs should be a priority for future research.},

	abstract = {1. In times of ongoing habitat fragmentation, the persistence of many species is determined by their dispersal abilities. Consequently, understanding the rules underlying movement between habitat patches is a key issue in conservation ecology. 2. We have analysed mark-release-recapture (MRR) data on inter-patches movements of the Dusky Large Blue butterfly Maculinea nausithous in a fragmented landscape in northern Bavaria, Germany. The aim of the analysis was to quantify distance dependence of dispersal as well as to evaluate the effect of target patch area on immigration probability. For statistical evaluation, we apply a ‘reduced version’ of the virtual migration model (VM), only fitting parameters for dispersal distance and immigration. In contrast to other analyses, we fit a mixed dispersal kernel to the MRR data. 3. A large fraction of recaptures happened in other habitat patches than those where individuals were initially caught. Further, we found significant evidence for the presence of a mixed dispersal kernel. The results indicate that individuals follow different strategies in their movements. Most movements are performed over small distances, nonetheless involving travelling between nearby habitat patches (median distance c. 480 m). A small fraction (c. 0·025) of the population has a tendency to move over larger distances (median distance c. 3800 m). Further, immigration was positively affected by patch area (I∼Aζ), with the scaling parameter ζ = 0·5. 4. Our findings should help to resolve the long-lasting dispute over the suitability of the negative exponential function vs. inverse-power one for modelling dispersal. Previous studies on various organisms found that the former typically gives better overall fit to empirical distance distributions, but that the latter better represents long-distance movement probabilities. As long-distance movements are more important for landscape-level effects and thus, e.g. for conservation-oriented analyses like PVAs, fitting inverse-power kernels has often been preferred. 5. We conclude that the above discrepancy may simply stem from the fact that recorded inter-patch movements are an outcome of two different processes: daily routine movements and genuine dispersal. Consequently, applying mixed dispersal kernels to disentangle the two processes is recommended.},

The presence and movement of 28 grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos were monitored for 15 mo in the southern Great Barrier Reef in relation to environmental conditions and biological factors. Twenty-eight models including water temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, rainfall and time (week or month), size and sex were tested against presence and activity space data and compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Model results for presence of individuals in relation to environmental conditions indicated that temperature and wind speed had weak effects, likely related to detectability. Models using 3 different measures of activity space indicated no relationship between shark activity space and environmental parameters. Week was a significant factor in the top performing activity space models, with males showing increased activity space during weeks in September, when mating is believed to occur. These results suggest changes in movement were biologically rather than environmentally driven. It appears that C. amblyrhynchos are adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions in coral reef habitats and that movement between or away from reef platforms is likely related to biological factors such as prey density, competition, reproduction or dispersal rather than environmental or seasonal changes.},

Here, we demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience of coral reef communities to natural disturbances, including coral bleaching, coral diseases, Acanthaster planci outbreaks and storms. Using a 20-year time series from Australia's Great Barrier Reef, we show that within MPAs, (1) reef community composition was 21–38\% more stable; (2) the magnitude of disturbance impacts was 30\% lower and (3) subsequent recovery was 20\% faster that in adjacent unprotected habitats. Our results demonstrate that MPAs can increase the resilience of marine communities to natural disturbance possibly through herbivory, trophic cascades and portfolio effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, an area almost the size of Japan, has a new network of no-take areas that significantly improves the protection of biodiversity. The new marine park zoning implements, in a quantitative manner, many of the theoretical design principles discussed in the literature. For example, the new network of no-take areas has at least 20\% protection per “bioregion,” minimum levels of protection for all known habitats and special or unique features, and minimum sizes for no-take areas of at least 10 or 20 km across at the smallest diameter. Overall, more than 33\% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is now in no-take areas (previously 4.5\%). The steps taken leading to this outcome were to clarify to the interested public why the existing level of protection was inadequate; detail the conservation objectives of establishing new no-take areas; work with relevant and independent experts to define, and contribute to, the best scientific process to deliver on the objectives; describe the biodiversity (e.g., map bioregions); define operational principles needed to achieve the objectives; invite community input on all of the above; gather and layer the data gathered in round-table discussions; report the degree of achievement of principles for various options of no-take areas; and determine how to address negative impacts. Some of the key success factors in this case have global relevance and include focusing initial communication on the problem to be addressed; applying the precautionary principle; using independent experts; facilitating input to decision making; conducting extensive and participatory consultation; having an existing marine park that encompassed much of the ecosystem; having legislative power under federal law; developing high-level support; ensuring agency priority and ownership; and being able to address the issue of displaced fishers.},

However, although the reproductive potential of important fishery species can dramatically increase inside reserves [5, 6, 7, 8], the extent to which larval offspring are exported and the relative contribution of reserves to recruitment in fished and protected populations are unknown [4, 9, 10, 11]. Using genetic parentage analyses, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for two species of exploited coral reef fish within a network of marine reserves on the Great Barrier Reef. In a 1,000 km2 study area, populations resident in three reserves exported 83\% (coral trout, Plectropomus maculatus) and 55\% (stripey snapper, Lutjanus carponotatus) of assigned offspring to fished reefs, with the remainder having recruited to natal reserves or other reserves in the region. We estimate that reserves, which account for just 28\% of the local reef area, produced approximately half of all juvenile recruitment to both reserve and fished reefs within 30 km. Our results provide compelling evidence that adequately protected reserve networks can make a significant contribution to the replenishment of populations on both reserve and fished reefs at a scale that benefits local stakeholders.},

	abstract = {The occurrence of sharks on coral reefs has been well documented for decades, especially since the advent of SCUBA diving. Despite this, it is only within the last decade that substantial research effort has been directed at these species. Research effort has increased in conjunction with the realization that reef shark populations have experienced signiﬁcant declines throughout their distribution. However, trends in declines have been coupled with reports of high abundance in some areas providing confusion about what healthy reef shark populations should look like. Given that coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and productive habitats, but also are one of the most threatened by climate change due to the effects of rising temperature and declining pH, there is a need to understand reef sharks to better predict consequences for their populations. Studies of reef sharks also have the potential to provide insights into the functioning of their populations and ecosystems more broadly because of the spatially constrained nature of their distributions, and high water visibility in most locations. These aspects make studying reef shark populations integral to understanding coral reef ecosystem dynamics and resilience to pressures. This paper synthesizes a number of key questions about coral reef sharks based on our experience researching this group of species over the past decade. Key research gaps and critical questions include aspects of life history, population dynamics, ecology, behavior, physiology, energetics, and more. This synthesis also considers the methods used to date, and what new and emerging techniques may be available to improve our understanding of reef shark populations. The synthesis will highlight how even basic questions relating to reef shark population sizes, how large they should be, and what impacts do they have on reef ecosystems, remain either unanswered or highly controversial.},

Post-peak chondrichthyan landings trajectories from 126 countries were modelled against seven indirect and direct ﬁshing pressure measures and eleven measures of ﬁsheries management performance, while accounting for ecosystem attributes. We found the recent improvement in international or national ﬁsheries management was not yet strong enough to account for the recent decline in chondrichthyan landings. Instead, the landings declines were more closely related to ﬁshing pressure and ecosystem attribute measures. Countries with the greatest declines had high human coastal population sizes or high shark and ray meat exports such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. While important progress had been made, country-level ﬁsheries management measures did not yet have the strength or coverage to halt overﬁshing and avert population declines of chondrichthyans. Increased implementation of legally binding operational ﬁsheries management and species-speciﬁc reporting is urgently required to avoid declines and ensure ﬁsheries sustainability and food security.},

Random walks are used when the locations of resources are unknown, whereas directed walks should be optimal when the location of favourable habitats is known. However, directed walks have been quantified for very few species. 3. We re-analysed tracking data from three shark species to determine whether they were using directed walks, and if so, over which spatial scales. Fractal analysis was used to quantify how movement structure varied with spatial scale and determine whether the sharks were using patches. 4. Tiger sharks performed directed walks at large spatial scales (at least 6-8 km). Thresher sharks also showed directed movement (at scales of 400-1900 m), and adult threshers were able to orient at greater scales than juveniles, which may suggest that learning improves the ability to perform directed walks. Blacktip reef sharks had small home ranges, high site fidelity and showed no evidence of oriented movements at large scales. 5. There were inter- and intraspecific differences in path structure and patch size, although most individuals showed scale-dependent movements. Furthermore, some individuals of each species performed movements similar to a correlated random walk. 6. Sharks can perform directed walks over large spatial scales, with scales of movements reflecting site fidelity and home range size. Understanding when and where directed walks occur is crucial for developing more accurate population-level dispersal models.},

	volume = {94},
	issn = {0012-9658},
	abstract = {Animals are often faced with complex movement decisions, particularly those that involve long-distance dispersal. Partial migrations, ubiquitous among all groups of vertebrates, are a form of long-distance movement that occurs when only some of the animals in a population migrate. The decision to migrate or to be a resident can be dependent on many factors, but these factors are rarely quantified in fishes, particularly top predators, even though partial migrations may have important implications for ecosystem dynamics and conservation. We utilized passive acoustic telemetry, with a Brownian bridge movement model and generalized additive mixed models, to explore the factors regulating partial migration in a large marine predator, the tiger shark, throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Although sharks tended to utilize a particular "core" island, they also demonstrated inter-island movements, particularly mature females that would swim from the northwestern Hawaiian Islands to the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Immigration to another island was a function of season, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a concentration. Our results predict that 25\% of mature females moved from remote French Frigate Shoals atoll to the MHI during late summer/early fall, potentially to give birth. Females with core home ranges within the MHI showed limited movements to the NWHI, and immigration to an island was better explained by SST and chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting a foraging function. Dispersal patterns in tiger sharks are complex but can be considered a mix of skipped-breeding partial migration by mature females and individual-based inter-island movements potentially linked to foraging. Therefore, sharks appear to use a conditional strategy based on fixed intrinsic and flexible extrinsic states. The application of Brownian bridge movement models to electronic presence/absence data provides a new technique for assessing the influence of habitat and environmental conditions on patterns of movement for fish populations.},

	abstract = {Overfishing of sharks is a global concern, with increasing numbers of species threatened by overfishing. For many sharks, both catch rates and underwater visual surveys have been criticized as indices of abundance. In this context, estimation of population trends using individual demographic rates provides an important alternative means of assessing population status. However, such estimates involve uncertainties that must be appropriately characterized to credibly and effectively inform conservation efforts and management. Incorporating uncertainties into population assessment is especially important when key demographic rates are obtained via indirect methods, as is often the case for mortality rates of marine organisms subject to fishing. Here, focusing on two reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, we estimated natural and total mortality rates using several indirect methods, and determined the population growth rates resulting from each. We used bootstrapping to quantify the uncertainty associated with each estimate, and to evaluate the extent of agreement between estimates. Multiple models produced highly concordant natural and total mortality rates, and associated population growth rates, once the uncertainties associated with the individual estimates were taken into account. Consensus estimates of natural and total population growth across multiple models support the hypothesis that these species are declining rapidly due to fishing, in contrast to conclusions previously drawn from catch rate trends. Moreover, quantitative projections of abundance differences on fished versus unfished reefs, based on the population growth rate estimates, are comparable to those found in previous studies using underwater visual surveys. These findings appear to justify management actions to substantially reduce the fishing mortality of reef sharks. They also highlight the potential utility of rigorously characterizing uncertainty, and applying multiple assessment methods, to obtain robust estimates of population trends in species threatened by overfishing.},

	abstract = {Snakebite causes more than 1.8 million envenoming cases annually and is a major cause of death in the tropics especially for poor farmers. While both social and ecological factors influence the chance encounter between snakes and people, the spatio-temporal processes underlying snakebites remain poorly explored. Previous research has focused on statistical correlates between snakebites and ecological, sociological, or environmental factors, but the human and snake behavioral patterns that drive the spatio-temporal process have not yet been integrated into a single model. Here we use a bottom-up simulation approach using agent-based modelling (ABM) parameterized with datasets from Sri Lanka, a snakebite hotspot, to characterise the mechanisms of snakebite and identify risk factors. Spatio-temporal dynamics of snakebite risks are examined through the model incorporating six snake species and three farmer types (rice, tea, and rubber). We find that snakebites are mainly climatically driven, but the risks also depend on farmer types due to working schedules as well as species present in landscapes. Snake species are differentiated by both distribution and by habitat preference, and farmers are differentiated by working patterns that are climatically driven, and the combination of these factors leads to unique encounter rates for different landcover types as well as locations. Validation using epidemiological studies demonstrated that our model can explain observed patterns, including temporal patterns of snakebite incidence, and relative contribution of bites by each snake species. Our predictions can be used to generate hypotheses and inform future studies and decision makers. Additionally, our model is transferable to other locations with high snakebite burden as well.},

	abstract = {Background Snakebite incidence shows both spatial and temporal variation. However, no study has evaluated spatiotemporal patterns of snakebites across a country or region in detail. We used a nationally representative population sample to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of snakebite in Sri Lanka. Methodology We conducted a community-based cross-sectional survey representing all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. We interviewed 165 665 people (0.8\% of the national population), and snakebite events reported by the respondents were recorded. Sri Lanka is an agricultural country; its central, southern and western parts receive rain mainly from Southwest monsoon (May to September) and northern and eastern parts receive rain mainly from Northeast monsoon (November to February). We developed spatiotemporal models using multivariate Poisson process modelling to explain monthly snakebite and envenoming incidences in the country. These models were developed at the provincial level to explain local spatiotemporal patterns. Principal findings Snakebites and envenomings showed clear spatiotemporal patterns. Snakebite hotspots were found in North-Central, North-West, South-West and Eastern Sri Lanka. They exhibited biannual seasonal patterns except in South-Western inlands, which showed triannual seasonality. Envenoming hotspots were confined to North-Central, East and South-West parts of the country. Hotspots in North-Central regions showed triannual seasonal patterns and South-West regions had annual patterns. Hotspots remained persistent throughout the year in Eastern regions. The overall monthly snakebite and envenoming incidences in Sri Lanka were 39 (95\%CI: 38–40) and 19 (95\%CI: 13–30) per 100 000, respectively, translating into 110 000 (95\%CI: 107 500–112 500) snakebites and 45 000 (95\%CI: 32 000–73 000) envenomings in a calendar year. Conclusions/significance This study provides information on community-based monthly incidence of snakebites and envenomings over the whole country. Thus, it provides useful insights into healthcare decision-making, such as, prioritizing locations to establish specialized centres for snakebite management and allocating resources based on risk assessments which take into account both location and season.},

	abstract = {Snakebite envenoming is a set of intoxication diseases that disproportionately affect people of poor socioeco­ nomic backgrounds in tropical countries. As it is highly dependent on the environment its burden is expected to shift spatially with global anthropogenic environmental (climate, land use) and demographic change. The mechanisms underlying the changes to snakebite epidemiology are related to factors of snakes and humans. The distribution and abundance of snakes are expected to change with global warming via their thermal tolerance, while rainfall may affect the timing of key activities like feeding and reproduction. Human population growth is the primary cause of land-use change, which may impact snakes at smaller spatial scales than climate via habitat and biodiversity loss (e.g. prey availability). Human populations, on the other hand, could experience novel patterns and morbidity of snakebite envenoming, both as a result of snake responses to environmental change and due to the development of agricultural adaptations to climate change, socioeconomic and cultural changes, development and availability of better antivenoms, personal protective equipment, and mechanization of agri­ culture that mediate risk of encounters with snakes and their outcomes. The likely global effects of environ­ mental and demographic change are thus context-dependent and could encompass both increasing and or snakebite burden (incidence, number of cases or morbidity), exposing new populations to snakes in temperate areas due to “tropicalization”, or by land use change-induced snake biodiversity loss, respectively. Tackling global change requires drastic measures to ensure large-scale ecosystem functionality. However, as ecosystems represent the main source of venomous snakes their conservation should be accompanied by comprehensive public health campaigns. The challenges associated with the joint efforts of biodiversity conservation and public health professionals should be considered in the global sustainability agenda in a wider context that applies to neglected tropical and zoonotic and emerging diseases.},

	abstract = {The present paper investigates the time-series properties of average rainfall and temperature readings of countries in Southeast Asia (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam) using monthly data, spanning from 1901 to 2016. Specifically, we analyze the time trend, persistence, and seasonality properties of the series using I(d) fractional integration framework, an approach that is found to be robust in dealing with climatological series. Antipersistence is observed in the rainfall series of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam while long memory is found in the rainfall series of the remaining countries. Thus, those countries with antipersistent rainfall are prone to erratic rainfall distribution which could lead to flooding or drought. Long memory is observed in the distribution of rainfall across all countries with increasing trend found in some cases. Both climatic variables display evidence supporting seasonality with stronger seasonality observed in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Findings in the present paper are of policy relevance to climate monitoring agencies and the government.},

	abstract = {The spatial variability of rainfall within a single Local Area Weather Radar (LAWR) pixel of 500 × 500 m is quantiﬁed based on data from two locations. The work was motivated by the need to quantify the variability on this scale in order to provide an estimate of the uncertainty of using a single rain gauge for calibrating the LAWR. A total of nine rain gauges were used, each representing one-ninth of the 500 × 500 m area. The analysis was carried out based on a dataset obtained using tipping bucket gauges during the summer and fall of 2007 and 2008, and the results were compared with results from an earlier campaign in 2003. The fact that the 2007–2008 dataset was almost four times larger than the original dataset from 2003 motivated this extended study. Two methods were used to describe the variability: the coefﬁcient of variation and the spatial correlation structure of the rainfall ﬁeld. Despite the small area of 0.25 km2, accumulated rainfall was found to vary signiﬁcantly within individual events with durations ranging from 5 min to 13 h. The coefﬁcient of variation was found to range from 1–26\% in the 2007–2008 dataset and in some special cases even higher. The 95\% prediction interval for a given rainfall depth is estimated and can be used to address the uncertainty of using a single rain gauge to represent the rainfall within a 500 × 500 m area.},

They can thus quantify constraints on survival, activity and, ultimately, the vital rates that determine population growth, given a sequence of environmental conditions and the key morphological, physiological and behavioural functional traits. Here we introduce and document the ectotherm model of NicheMapR, an R package that includes a suite of programs for the mechanistic modelling of heat, water, energy and mass exchange between any kind of ectothermic organism and its environment. The NicheMapR ectotherm model is based on a Fortran program originally developed by Porter, Mitchell and Beckman for predicting core body temperature and evaporative water loss as a function of microclimatic conditions and behavioural thermoregulation. The model includes routines for computing steady state body temperature and evaporative water loss given two extreme microclimates (minimum and maximum shade) as computed by the NicheMapR microclimate model. Behavioural options include posture and colour change, shade-seeking, panting, climbing and retreating underground. Here we configure the program to be called from R as part of the NicheMapR package and describe the model in detail including new functionality for modelling whole life-cycle energy and water budgets using Dynamic Energy Budget theory. We include scripts for core operation of the ectotherm model as well as stand-alone R scripts for running the DEB model. Example applications are provided in the paper and in the associated vignettes. The integrated microclimate and ectotherm models should provide a strong thermodynamic basis for determining the effects of environmental change on the behaviour, distribution and abundance of ectothermic organisms.},

We present a probabilistic treatment of the presence-only problem and derive a method to assess the performance of SDMs based on the analysis of an area-presence plot and the SDM outputs represented in both geographic and environmental spaces. We show how our method is useful to solve the two main tasks for which the AUC is used: assessing the performance of an SDM and comparing the performance of different SDMs. Our results build on previous work and constitute a rigorous method for assessing the performance of SDMs in relation to a random classifier. We establish comparisons with two of the most popular approaches used to assess the performance of an SDM, the AUC and the Boyce index, and identified cases in which our method has advantages over these two approaches. We suggest that the performance of an algorithm that classifies presence-only data can be assessed by two factors: (a) the degree of non-randomness of the classification at every step in the accumulation curve of presences, and (b) the amount of uninformative niche space used for the classification. The method we developed can be applied to any SDM output by using the R functions available at: https://github.com/LauraJim/SDM-hyperTest.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity studies rely heavily on estimates of species' distributions often obtained through ecological niche modelling. Numerous software packages exist that allow users to model ecological niches using machine learning and statistical methods. However, no existing package with a graphical user interface allows users to perform model calibration and selection based on convex forms such as ellipsoids, which may match fundamental ecological niche shapes better, incorporating tools for exploring, modelling, and evaluating niches and distributions that are intuitive for both novice and proficient users. Here we describe an r package, NicheToolBox (ntbox), that allows users to conduct all processing steps involved in ecological niche modelling: downloading and curating occurrence data, obtaining and transforming environmental data layers, selecting environmental variables, exploring relationships between geographic and environmental spaces, calibrating and selecting ellipsoid models, evaluating models using binomial and partial ROC tests, assessing extrapolation risk, and performing geographic information system operations via a graphical user interface. A summary of the entire workflow is produced for use as a stand-alone algorithm or as part of research reports. The method is explained in detail and tested via modelling the threatened feline species Leopardus wiedii. Georeferenced occurrence data for this species are queried to display both point occurrences and the IUCN extent of occurrence polygon (IUCN, 2007). This information is used to illustrate tools available for accessing, processing and exploring biodiversity data (e.g. number of occurrences and chronology of collecting) and transforming environmental data (e.g. a summary PCA for 19 bioclimatic layers). Visualizations of three-dimensional ecological niches modelled as minimum volume ellipsoids are developed with ancillary statistics. This niche model is then projected to geographic space, to represent a corresponding potential suitability map. Using ntbox allows a fast and straightforward means by which to retrieve and manipulate occurrence and environmental data, which can then be implemented in model calibration, projection and evaluation for assessing distributions of species in geographic space and their corresponding environmental combinations.},

A composite model is a term that has been applied to mathematically tractable models that have parameters which were derived in an obvious fashion from more complex, and ecologically meaningful, simulation models. This approach to modeling was motivated by the difficulty in producing models that simultaneously satisfy the requirements of ecological fidelity and mathematical tractability. The modeling paradigm discussed in this paper is to first develop a model that satisfies the requirement of ecological realism. Then, through application of various mathematical procedures and ecological intuition, successively more abstract, simplified models are developed. The final objective is an ecologically credible model amenable to mathematical analysis. I first discuss the problem in general terms and then illustrate its application by a specific problem.},

Metabolic theories provide general, parameter-sparse frameworks for understanding these constraints. However, they require the accurate estimation of body temperature which can be especially challenging in terrestrial environments. 2. Here, I integrate a metabolic theory (Dynamic Energy Budget theory, DEB) with a biophysical model for inferring field body temperatures and activity periods of terrestrial ectotherms and apply it to study life-history variation and geographic range limits in a widespread North American lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. 3. The model successfully predicted trait co-variation (size at maturity, maximum size, reproductive output and length-mass allometry) through changes in a single parameter. It also predicted seasonal and geographic variation in field growth rates, age at first reproduction, reproductive output and geographic range limits (via rmax estimates), all as a function of spatial climatic data. Although variation in age at maturity was mostly explained by climate, variation in annual reproduction was largely a product of local body size. 4. Dynamic Energy Budget metabolic theory is concluded to be a powerful and general means to mechanistically integrate the dynamics of growth and reproduction into niche models of ectotherms.},

Correlative ecological niche modeling is among the most frequently used tools with which to estimate potential distributions of invasive species. However, when areas accessible to the species across its native distribution do not represent the full spectrum of environmental conditions that the species can tolerate, correlative studies often underestimate fundamental niches. Methods Here, we explore the utility of supraspecific modeling units to improve the predictive ability of models focused on biological invasions. Taking into account phylogenetic relationships in correlative ecological niche models, we studied the invasion patterns of three species (Aedes aegypti, Pterois volitans and Oreochromis mossambicus). Results Use of supraspecific modeling units improved the predictive ability of correlative niche models in anticipating potential distributions of three invasive species. We demonstrated that integrating data on closely related species allowed a more complete characterization of fundamental niches. This approach could be used to model species with invasive potential but that have not yet invaded new regions.},

	abstract = {Recent studies based on niche modeling to estimate the distribution of species have provided evidence that the abundance of a species decreases as the distance to the centroid of the climatic niche of the species increases. This empirical relationship is determined using correlative models that relate the presence/absence of a species with abiotic factors under the assumption that species are in equilibrium with its environment, but without taking into account population processes explicitly. The lack of a mechanism that explicitly relates population processes to the niche hinders to interpret results and obtain general conclusions. In this paper the relationship between habitat suitability and abundance under different dispersal scenarios is explored using a virtual species. A clear correlation between abundance and habitat suitability in scenarios without dispersal was found, on the other hand, this correlation decreased as the proportion of individuals who are dispersed increases. These results support the idea that there is a relationship between habitat suitability and abundances, however, they also show that this relationship is modulated by dispersal.},

	abstract = {Reporting of snakebite is poor in areas where they are most common. Comparatively, bites by snakes of high medical importance are likely to be documented than snakes of lesser medical importance. This study aims to describe the demographic, epidemiological and, clinical data of patients who were presented during a 49-month study period to a tertiary care center in rural Sri Lanka following authenticated bites by snakes of lesser medical importance. Of the total of 2362 confirmed snakebite patients during the study period, 517 (22\%) presented with the offending snake specimen. Of them, 76 (15\%) were identified as snakes of lesser medical importance and were included in this study. There were 41 (54\%) females. The median ages of females and males were 35 and 43 years respectively. Most patients (86\%) were bitten indoors or at home gardens. More than half of them were bitten between 1800 and 0000 h. Most bites (54\%) had occurred to the ankle or below. The patients were bitten by 12 species of colubrids, one pythonid (Python molurus), and one viperid (Trimeresurus trigonocephalus). The snake species that caused the most-number of bites was the Trinket snake (Coelognathus helena) (n = 15). Three species of wolf-snakes, Lycodon aulicus, L. anamallensis, and L. striatus were responsible for 12, 11, and 5 bites respectively. Most of the patients (55\%) presented to the local hospital and subsequently transferred to the study hospital for further management. None of the patients developed systemic envenoming and five developed mild local pain and swelling. Fifty-six (74\%) patients were discharged on the following day, while 18 (24\%) were discharged on the third day. There is a need to educate medical personnel working the peripheral hospital on how to identify medically lesser important snakes to avoid unnecessary transfers.},

In the present study the habitat ecology, threats and conservation strategies for the Hump-nosed Pit Viper Hypnale hypnale are suggested. The present study was undertaken in some protected areas (PAs) of Goa and the cashew plantations adjoining these PAs. H. hypnale prefers cool and moist places; most of the females of this species are found to spend the period from post monsoon to late summer in the cashew plantations adjoining and within the PAs, making them more susceptible to anthropogenic threats. We conclude that this pattern of seasonal changes in habitat use is mostly a consequence of niche conservation. However, this preference for a particular micro-habitat emphasizes the importance for the conservation of this snake population and although the most suitable habitat in the Western Ghats, for this species is included in the protected areas, specific guidelines are needed to assess conservation needs.},

Influenza, plague, and trypanosomiasis are classic examples of zoonoses, or infections that transmit from animals to humans. The multi-host ecology of zoonoses leads to complex dynamics, and analytical tools such as mathematical modeling are vital to the development of effective control policies and research agendas. Much attention has focused on modeling pathogens with simpler life cycles and immediate global urgency, such as influenza and SARS, but vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as cross-species transmission. Progress in understanding and combating zoonoses requires a new generation of models that addresses a broader set of pathogen life histories and integrates across host species and scientific disciplines.},

	abstract = {Snakebite envenoming is a major neglected tropical health issue. The high incidence of snakebites in tropical rural communities suggests that venomous snakes and people are often in proximity but quantitative evidence is lacking. I used radio-telemetry on a population of Russell’s vipers (Daboia russelii), one of the most medically important snakes in the world, to quantify proximity between this venomous snake and people and estimate susceptibility to snakebite envenoming. I observed people ≤50 m of a radio-equipped viper in 17\% of 2066 snake re-locations. People were more frequently observed in proximity to Russell’s vipers in January and July compared to March, but all other contrasts were statistically similar. This pattern indicates that snakebite incidence, which peaks in summer in the study area, is not particularly linked to the encounter frequency between people and vipers. However, consistent with epidemiological data plantation workers were the most at-risk part of the population. By integrating information about the locations of humans and snakes in space and time, this pioneering research highlights the need to include snake ecology into the study of the human–venomous snake conflict, and provides a model approach to help mitigate the burden caused by venomous snakes in the rural tropics.},

Although over 100 studies have been published, the value of this information is increased when it is collated, allowing rapid assimilation and evaluation of evolutionary trends, geographical variation, and possible medical implications. This review brings together all compositional studies of snake venom proteomes published in the last decade. Compositional studies were identiﬁed for 132 snake species: 42 from 360 (12\%) Elapidae (elapids), 20 from 101 (20\%) Viperinae (true vipers), 65 from 239 (27\%) Crotalinae (pit vipers), and ﬁve species of non-front-fanged snakes. Approximately 90\% of their total venom composition consisted of eight protein families for elapids, 11 protein families for viperines and ten protein families for crotalines. There were four dominant protein families: phospholipase A2s (the most common across all front-fanged snakes), metalloproteases, serine proteases and three-ﬁnger toxins. There were six secondary protein families: cysteine-rich secretory proteins, L-amino acid oxidases, kunitz peptides, C-type lectins/snaclecs, disintegrins and natriuretic peptides. Elapid venoms contained mostly three-ﬁnger toxins and phospholipase A2s and viper venoms metalloproteases, phospholipase A2s and serine proteases. Although 63 protein families were identiﬁed, more than half were present in {\textless}5\% of snake species studied and always in low abundance. The importance of these minor component proteins remains unknown.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES To identify historical features, clinical examination findings, basic laboratory testing, and clinical grading scales that will risk-stratify patients with pit viper snake envenomation for severe systemic envenomation, severe tissue injury, and/or severe hematologic venom effects. DATA SOURCES We conducted a structured search of PubMed (1966-October 3, 2017) and Embase database (1980-October 3, 2017) to identify English-language studies that evaluated clinical features predictive of severe envenomation. STUDY SELECTION We included studies that evaluated the test performance of at least 1 clinical finding with an acceptable reference standard of severe envenomation for venomous snakes of the Western Hemisphere. Only studies involving the most common subfamily, Crotalinae (pit vipers), were evaluated. Seventeen studies with data were available for abstraction. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The clinical features assessed and severity outcome measures were extracted from each original study. We assessed severity in 3 categories: systemic toxicity, tissue injury, and hematologic effects. Differences were resolved by author consensus.
RESULTS The pooled prevalence of severe systemic envenomation was 14\% (95\% CI, 9\%-21\%). The pooled prevalence of severe tissue injury and severe hematologic venom effects were 14\% (95\% CI, 12\%-16\%) and 18\% (95\% CI, 8\%-27\%), respectively. Factors increasing the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation included the time from bite to care of 6 or more hours (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4 [95\% CI, 1.1-6.4]), a patient younger than 12 years (LRs, 3.2 [95\% CI, 1.5-7.1] and 2.9 [95\% CI, 1.3-6.2]), large snake size (LR, 3.1 [95\% CI, 1.5-5.7]), and ptosis (LRs, 1.4 [95\% CI, 1.0-2.1] and 3.8 [95\% CI, 1.8-8.3]). Envenomation by the genus Agkistrodon (copperhead and cottonmouth), as opposed to rattlesnakes, decreased the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation (LR, 0.28 [95\% CI, 0.10-0.78]). Initial hypofibrinogenemia (LR, 5.1 [95\% CI, 1.7-15.0]) and thrombocytopenia (LR, 3.7 [95\% CI, 1.9-7.3]) increased the likelihood of severe hematologic venom effects. Other clinical features from history, physical examination, or normal laboratory values were not discriminative.
CONCLUSIONS Clinical features can identify patients at increased risk of severe systemic envenomation and severe hematologic venom effects, but there are few features that are associated with severe tissue injury or can confidently exclude severe envenomation. Physicians should monitor patients closely and be wary of progression from nonsevere to a severe envenomation and have a low threshold to escalate therapy as needed.},

Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100\% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.},

Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5◦ latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way. This gridded product will be publicly available, including the input station series (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ and http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/).},

Simulation models at regional to global scales are often incapable of including locally determined processes of land use change. This paper introduces a modeling approach that integrates demand-driven changes in land area with locally determined conversion processes. The model is illustrated with an application for European land use. Interactions between changing demands for agricultural land and vegetation processes leading to the re-growth of (semi-) natural vegetation on abandoned farmland are explicitly addressed. Succession of natural vegetation is simulated based on the spatial variation in biophysical and management related conditions, while the dynamics of the agricultural area are determined by a global multi-sector model. The results allow an exploration of the future dynamics of European land use and landscapes. The model approach is similarly suitable for other regions and processes where large scale processes interact with local dynamics.},

NTD interventions have the greatest relevance for SDG3, the health goal, where the focus on equity, and its commitment to reaching people in need of health services, wherever they may live and whatever their circumstances, is fundamentally aligned with the target of Universal Health Coverage. NTD interventions, however, also affect and are affected by many of the other development areas covered under the 2030 Agenda. Strategies such as mass drug administration or the programmatic integration of NTD and WASH activities (SDG6) are driven by effective global partnerships (SDG17). Intervention against the NTDs can also have an impact on poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), can improve education (SDG4), work and economic growth (SDG8), thereby reducing inequalities (SDG10). The community-led distribution of donated medicines to more than 1 billion people reinforces women’s empowerment (SDG5), logistics infrastructure (SDG9) and non-discrimination against disability (SDG16). Interventions to curb mosquito-borne NTDs contribute to the goals of urban sustainability (SDG11) and resilience to climate change (SDG13), while the safe use of insecticides supports the goal of sustainable ecosystems (SDG15). Although indirectly, interventions to control waterand animal-related NTDs can facilitate the goals of small-scale fishing (SDG14) and sustainable hydroelectricity and biofuels (SDG7). NTDs proliferate in less developed areas in countries across the income spectrum, areas where large numbers of people have little or no access to adequate health care, clean water, sanitation, housing, education, transport and information. This scoping review assesses how in this context, ending the epidemic of the NTDs can impact and improve our prospects of attaining the SDGs.},

Nevertheless, highly diverse ecosystems have collapsed, as did Lake Victoria’s ecosystem of cichlids or Caribbean coral reefs. We try to gain insight to this paradox, by analyzing a simple model of a diverse community where each competing species inflicts a small mortality pressure on an introduced predator. High diversity strengthens this feedback and prevents invasion of the introduced predator. After a gradual loss of native species, the introduced predator can escape control and the system collapses into a contrasting, invaded, low-diversity state. Importantly, we find that a diverse system that has high complementarity gains in resilience, whereas a diverse system with high functional redundancy gains in resistance. Loss of resilience can display early-warning signals of a collapse, but loss of resistance not. Our results emphasize the need for multiple approaches to studying the functioning of ecosystems, as managing an ecosystem requires understanding not only the threats it is vulnerable to but also pressures it appears resistant to.},

	abstract = {Monthly total precipitation and mean temperature climate surfaces, gridded to 30-arcseconds (≈1 km at the equator) and available for all global land areas, are presented. These datasets are generated with a Delta downscaling method, using the 30-arcsecond WorldClim climatologies to scale monthly anomaly grids. For monthly mean temperature, the anomalies are constructed from both the Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Willmott \& Matsuura (W\&M) 0.5 degree time-series datasets, whereas for monthly precipitation Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data are also used. The 0.5 degree anomalies are then interpolated to the 30-arcsecond resolution. Use of piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomials (PCHIP) to interpolate the anomaly grids results in more physically representative Delta downscaled surfaces, compared to bilinear and cubic spline interpolation. The Delta downscaled products are compared to Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) station records for six test regions distributed globally. In this analysis, the Delta grids produced using the W\&M time-series dataset perform better than grids produced using GPCC or CRU. Using Oregon, USA as a test region, the Delta downscaled datasets are compared to the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) datasets. For monthly precipitation, PRISM performs better than each of the three Delta downscaled datasets, but for mean temperature both Delta downscaled datasets outperform PRISM. Through computing the Pearson product–moment correlation coefﬁcient between GHCN station delineated errors in the WorldClim climatologies and the Delta downscaled W\&M data, it is shown that performance of the Delta grids corresponds strongly to performance of the reference climatologies. Therefore, future improvement of the 30-arcsecond Delta grids described in this article is strongly tied to advances in the high-resolution climatological data for all global land surfaces. The Delta downscaled datasets discussed herein are open-source and freely distributed at http://www.globalclimatedata.org.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, malaria has become established in zones at the margin of its previous distribution, especially in the highlands of East Africa. Studies in this region have sparked a heated debate over the importance of climate change in the territorial expansion of malaria, where positions range from its neglect to the reiﬁcation of correlations as causes. Here, we review studies supporting and rebutting the role of climatic change as a driving force for highland invasion by malaria. We assessed the conclusions from both sides of the argument and found that evidence for the role of climate in these dynamics is robust. However, we also argue that over-emphasizing the importance of climate is misleading for setting a research agenda, even one which attempts to understand climate change impacts on emerging malaria patterns. We review alternative drivers for the emergence of this disease and highlight the problems still calling for research if the multidimensional nature of malaria is to be adequately tackled. We also contextualize highland malaria as an ongoing evolutionary process. Finally, we present Schmalhausen’s law, which explains the lack of resilience in stressed systems, as a biological principle that uniﬁes the importance of climatic and other environmental factors in driving malaria patterns across different spatio-temporal scales.},

	abstract = {Maximizing food production for feeding a rapidly growing human population while minimizing critical resource use and soil quality degradation is a major challenge for global sustainability. Sustainable agricultural practices based on low-external input is of paramount importance for reducing environmental trade-offs and planet healthy food production. Therefore, a critical assessment was made on viable low-input technologies aimed to reduce the negative effects of agricultural production as well as the use of various crop simulation models for forecasting the agricultural production under changing climatic scenario. While crop simulation models are helpful for predicting the growth and yield of individual crops under current as well as futuristic scenarios, it is difficult to model the response of multiple cropping systems under changing climatic conditions. As a matter of fact, the developing countries, majorly dependent on agriculture are most vulnerable to climate change. The increasing price of agrochemicals is another setback for subsistence farmers in resource-poor nations. In this backdrop, the current review aimed to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture, and the role of low input sustainable agriculture (LISA) for ensuring the food security while safeguarding the critical natural resources for human-wellbeing and also for attaining UN-Sustainable Development Goals. In addition, evidencebased impacts of LISA in emerging economies from Africa and South Asia are highlighted and suitable ecological indicators for measuring the sustainability of such LISA are addressed in brief. We conclude that the large-scale implementation of LISA will facilitate agricultural sustainability, and therefore, suitable policy frameworks are imperative for its worldwide adoption.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to understand the impacts of global climate change (GCC) on the distribution of dangerous venomous snakes and snakebite risk in Mozambique, as a contribution to the enhancement of public health policies and snake conservation. We modelled current and future distribution of all 13 dangerous snakes occurring in Mozambique using ecological niche models to assess the likely impacts of climate change estimated as the difference between lost and gained climatic suitable area per species. In addition, we developed a normalized index of snakebite risk based on species diversity and species-specific traits for each time slice. We then superimposed our index to data on human population density to identify areas most prone to this burden. Our findings suggest considerable future reduction in climatically suitable area for nine out of 13 species, with species experiencing a north-south range shift and high rates of species turnover in northern Mozambique. We also found that GCC might alter the spatial patterns of snakebite risk in the country, with considerable increase in the future, affecting most areas in central and southern regions. This finding suggests that GCC will be harmful to venomous snakes in Mozambique with potentially adverse effects on public health. As GCC might induce the approximation of snake climatic suitable areas to highly populated areas, efforts are needed to increase human knowledge of snakebite prevention measures and increase awareness of the relative safety and attacking behaviour associated with some of the snakes studied here ensuring reduction in snakebites and improving species conservation.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact across every domain of society, including health. The majority of the world’s population is susceptible to pathological, infectious disease whose life cycles are sensitive to environmental factors across different physical phases including air, water and soil. Nearly all so-called neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) fall into this category, meaning that future geographic patterns of transmission of dozens of infections are likely to be affected by climate change over the short (seasonal), medium (annual) and long (decadal) term. This review offers an introduction into the terms and processes deployed in modelling climate change and reviews the state of the art in terms of research into how climate change may affect future transmission of NTDs. The 34 infections included in this chapter are drawn from the WHO NTD list and the WHO blueprint list of priority diseases. For the majority of infections, some evidence is available of which environmental factors contribute to the population biology of parasites, vectors and zoonotic hosts. There is a general paucity of published research on the potential effects of decadal climate change, with some exceptions, mainly in vectorborne diseases.},

	abstract = {Reducing the burden of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is one of the key strategic targets advanced by the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the unprecedented effort deployed for NTD elimination in the past decade, their control, mainly through drug administration, remains particularly challenging: persistent poverty and repeated exposure to pathogens embedded in the environment limit the efficacy of strategies focused exclusively on human treatment or medical care. Here, we present a simple modelling framework to illustrate the relative role of ecological and socio-economic drivers of environmentally transmitted parasites and pathogens. Through the analysis of system dynamics, we show that periodic drug treatments that lead to the elimination of directly transmitted diseases may fail to do so in the case of human pathogens with an environmental reservoir. Control of environmentally transmitted diseases can be more effective when human treatment is complemented with interventions targeting the environmental reservoir of the pathogen. We present mechanisms through which the environment can influence the dynamics of poverty via disease feedbacks. For illustration, we present the case studies of Buruli ulcer and schistosomiasis, two devastating waterborne NTDs for which control is particularly challenging.

Hence, this study enrolled all consecutive Russell’s viper bite admissions to the ‘Unit A’ of General Hospital, Anuradhapura, over a two year period from January 1996, to describe the epidemiology, clinical picture, treatment and outcome. There were 336 cases which showed the following results. The male: female ratio was 5:1; 75\% of patients were below the age of 40 years. Biting occurred mainly in paddy fields 41\%, and on footpaths 29\% at dusk or dawn. Envenoming manifested in 310 (92\%) of patients as follows: local swelling 92\%, local necrosis 8.9\%, coagulopathy 77\%, neurotoxicity 78\%, nephrotoxicity 18\%, cardiac effects 3-12\% and myotoxicity 14\%. Coagulopathy appeared within 30 minutes to 12 hours after the bite and was corrected within 1 hour to 48 hours (mode 20 hours). Neurotoxicity recovered spontaneously in 1 to 5 days (mode 3 days); however, eight patients needed mechanical ventilation. Thirteen (4\%) of patients were managed with peritoneal dialysis because of hyperkalemia caused by a hypercatabolic state (7) and acute renal failure (6). The mortality rate of the series was 2.6\% (9 patients). Rural dry zone paddy farmers are the common victims of Russell’s viper bite in Sri Lanka and its’ envenoming leads to diverse clinical manifestations. Therefore, practically feasible preventive measures should be developed to minimize the incidence of bite and an evidence based management guideline should be developed for hospital practice.},

	abstract = {Objective: To describe the epidemiology of snake bite in the region and attempt to compare proven Russell’s viper with hump-nosed viper bites. Methods: All snake bite admissions to the Toxicology Unit of Teaching Hospital Peradeniya over three year from 2006 were included. Results: Of the 776 snakebites, 665(86\%) were unidentified and non-envenomed. Humpnosed viper and Russell’s viper accounted for 55(7\%) and 40(5\%) bites respectively, of them, incriminated snakes were found in 36(65\%) and 19(48\%) cases. The cobra bites-5, krait bites-0. The median ages: Russell’s viper bites-41(range 16-66), hump-nosed viper bites-42(range 1575). The gender incidence, time of bite ({\textgreater}58\% daytime) were similar. In hump-nosed viper bite; upper limb involved in 13(36\%), happened at home garden in 22(61\%), none in paddy fields. In Russell’s viper bite; 6(33\%) occurred in paddy fields. Dry bites were similar at 5\%. In humpnosed viper bite: local effects 94\%, coagulopathy 3\%, acute renal failure 3\% and one patient died. In Russell’s viper bite; local effects 84\%, coagulopathy 53\%, neurotoxicity 21\%. Abdominal pain occurred only in Russell’s viper bites 10(53\%). Conclusions: Overwhelming numbers of unidentified, non-envenomed snakebites are common in the central hills. Some distinctive differences were observed between Russell’s viper and hump-nosed viper bites.},

Hence, this study enrolled all consecutive Russell’s viper bite admissions to the ‘Unit A’ of General Hospital, Anuradhapura, over a two year period from January 1996, to describe the epidemiology, clinical picture, treatment and outcome. There were 336 cases which showed the following results. The male: female ratio was 5:1; 75\% of patients were below the age of 40 years. Biting occurred mainly in paddy fields 41\%, and on footpaths 29\% at dusk or dawn. Envenoming manifested in 310 (92\%) of patients as follows: local swelling 92\%, local necrosis 8.9\%, coagulopathy 77\%, neurotoxicity 78\%, nephrotoxicity 18\%, cardiac effects 3-12\% and myotoxicity 14\%. Coagulopathy appeared within 30 minutes to 12 hours after the bite and was corrected within 1 hour to 48 hours (mode 20 hours). Neurotoxicity recovered spontaneously in 1 to 5 days (mode 3 days); however, eight patients needed mechanical ventilation. Thirteen (4\%) of patients were managed with peritoneal dialysis because of hyperkalemia caused by a hypercatabolic state (7) and acute renal failure (6). The mortality rate of the series was 2.6\% (9 patients). Rural dry zone paddy farmers are the common victims of Russell’s viper bite in Sri Lanka and its’ envenoming leads to diverse clinical manifestations. Therefore, practically feasible preventive measures should be developed to minimize the incidence of bite and an evidence based management guideline should be developed for hospital practice.},

The study investigates risk factors associated with environmental, animal and occupational exposure while acknowledging the potential bias due to hanta viral infections in the study samples. Data were obtained from structured interviews with 483 patients (276 cases and 207 controls). Risk exposures were studied for the entire population and for two stratiﬁed occupational groups: non-paddy workers and paddy workers. A higher odds ratio (OR) of leptospirosis transmission for paddy workers was observed compared to non-paddy workers (OR 1.905, 95\% CI 1.274–2.856). Rat exposure was not associated with a signiﬁcant higher risk for any of the groups. Instead, cattle and household animals seemed to be important for transmission of leptospirosis to humans, especially among non-paddy workers (OR 10.655, 95\% CI 1.213–93.582). Leptospirosis in paddy workers was associated with environmental factors linked to contamination and wetness in paddy ﬁelds. Interestingly, abandoned paddy ﬁelds were found to have a protective effect against transmission to paddy workers (OR 0.421, 95\% CI 0.237–0.748). Keeping animals on these dryer ﬁelds may act as a boundary for contamination of paddy ﬁelds with infectious animal urine. This ﬁnding may be considered as a public health intervention targeting leptospirosis among paddy workers.},

	abstract = {A deep understanding of the composition of venoms and of the principles governing the evolution of venomous systems is of applied importance for exploring the enormous potential of venoms as sources of chemical and pharmacological novelty but also to fight the dire consequences of snakebite envenomings. This goal is now within the reach of “omic” technologies. A central thesis developed in this essay is the view that making sense of the huge inventory of data gathered through “omic” approaches requires the integration of this information across the biological system. Key to this is the identification of evolutionary and ecological trends; without the evolutionary link, systems venomics is relegated to a set of miscellaneous facts. The interplay between chance and adaptation plays a central role in the evolution of biological systems (Monod, 1970). However, the evolution of venomous species and their venoms do not always follow the same course, and the identification of structural and functional convergences and divergences among venoms is often unpredictable by a phylogenetic hypothesis. Toxins sharing a structural fold present in venoms from phylogenetically distant snakes often share antigenic determinants. The deficit of antivenom supply in certain regions of the world can be mitigated in part through the optimized use of existing antivenoms, and through the design of novel broad-range polyspecific antivenoms. Proteomics-guided identification of evolutionary and immunoreactivity trends among homologous and heterologous venoms may aid in the replacement of the traditional geographic- and phylogenetic-driven hypotheses for antivenom production strategies by a more rationale approach based on a hypothesis-driven systems venomics approach. Selected applications of venomics and antivenomics for exploring the chemical space and immunological profile of venoms will illustrate the author's views on the impact these proteomics tools may have in the field of toxinology.},

	abstract = {Road traffic kills hundreds of millions of animals every year, posing a critical threat to the populations of many species. To address this problem there are more than forty types of road mitigation measures available that aim to reduce wildlife mortality on roads (road-kill). For road planners, deciding on what mitigation method to use has been problematic because there is little good information about the relative effectiveness of these measures in reducing road-kill, and the costs of these measures vary greatly. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 50 studies that quantified the relationship between road-kill and a mitigation measure designed to reduce road-kill. Overall, mitigation measures reduce road-kill by 40\% compared to controls. Fences, with or without crossing structures, reduce road-kill by 54\%. We found no detectable effect on road-kill of crossing structures without fencing. We found that comparatively expensive mitigation measures reduce large mammal road-kill much more than inexpensive measures. For example, the combination of fencing and crossing structures led to an 83\% reduction in road-kill of large mammals, compared to a 57\% reduction for animal detection systems, and only a 1\% for wildlife reflectors. We suggest that inexpensive measures such as reflectors should not be used until and unless their effectiveness is tested using a high-quality experimental approach. Our meta-analysis also highlights the fact that there are insufficient data to answer many of the most pressing questions that road planners ask about the effectiveness of road mitigation measures, such as whether other less common mitigation measures (e.g., measures to reduce traffic volume and/or speed) reduce road mortality, or to what extent the attributes of crossing structures and fences influence their effectiveness. To improve evaluations of mitigation effectiveness, studies should incorporate data collection before the mitigation is applied, and we recommend a minimum study duration of four years for Before-After, and a minimum of either four years or four sites for Before-After-Control-Impact designs.},

Surprisingly, we have tended to consider only the positive values of ecosystems, their ecosystem services. In addition to providing our food and water, Nature also kills us, primarily through disease. If we are to effectively manage the terrestrial Earth, we need to also manage species, habitats and ecosystems so as to minimize such ‘ecosystem disservices’. I consider what we know about the spatial pattern of one disservice, pathogen prevalence and how changes in habitat inﬂuence it. I consider the effects of habitat changes on pathogen prevalence and, consequently, ecosystem disservices. In the end, we need to weigh both the costs and the beneﬁts of particular ecosystems, habitats and species – to consider the bad with the good. Doing so requires that we learn much more about the biota than we currently know.},

	abstract = {Agricultural ecosystems are actively managed by humans to optimize the provision of food, fiber, and fuel. These ecosystem services from agriculture, classified as provisioning services by the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, depend in turn upon a web of supporting and regulating services as inputs to production (e.g., soil fertility and pollination). Agriculture also receives ecosystem dis-services that reduce productivity or increase production costs (e.g., herbivory and competition for water and nutrients by undesired species). The flows of these services and dis-services directly depend on how agricultural ecosystems are managed and upon the diversity, composition, and functioning of remaining natural ecosystems in the landscape. Managing agricultural landscapes to provide sufficient supporting and regulating ecosystem services and fewer dis-services will require research that is policy-relevant, multidisciplinary and collaborative. This paper focuses on how ecosystem services contribute to agricultural productivity and how ecosystem dis-services detract from it. We first describe the major services and dis-services as well as their key mediators. We then explore the importance of scale and economic externalities for the management of ecosystem service provision to agriculture. Finally, we discuss outstanding issues in regard to improving the management of ecosystem services and dis-services to agriculture.},

This definition highlights social resilience in relation to the concept of ecological resilience which is a characteristic of ecosystems to maintain themselves in the face of disturbance. There is a clear link between social and ecological resilience, particularly for social groups or communities that are dependent on ecological and environmental resources for their livelihoods. But it is not clear whether resilient ecosystems enable resilient communities in such situations. This article examines whether resilience is a useful characteristic for describing the social and economic situation of social groups and explores potential links between social resilience and ecological resilience. The origins of this interdisciplinary study in human ecology, ecological economics and rural sociology are reviewed, and a study of the impacts of ecological change on a resourcedependent community in contemporary coastal Vietnam in terms of the resilience of its institutions is outlined.},

	abstract = {Transportation infrastructure can cause an ecological trap if it attracts wildlife for foraging and travel opportunities, while increasing the risk of mortality from collisions. This situation occurs for a vulnerable population of grizzly bears (
              Ursus arctos
              ) in Banff National Park, Canada, where train strikes have become a leading cause of mortality. We explored this problem with analyses of rail-associated food attractants, habitat use of GPS-collared bears and patterns of past mortality. Bears appeared to be attracted to grain spilled from rail cars, enhanced growth of adjacent vegetation and train-killed ungulates with rail use that increased in spring and autumn, and in areas where trains slowed, topography was rugged, and human density was low. However, areas with higher grain deposits or greater use by bears did not predict sites of past mortality. The onset of reported train strikes occurred amid several other interacting changes in this landscape, including the cessation of lethal bear management, changes in the distribution and abundance of ungulates, increasing human use and new anthropogenic features. We posit that rapid learning by bears is critical to their persistence in this landscape and that this capacity might be enhanced to prevent train strikes in future with simple warning devices, such as the one we invented, that signal approaching trains.

	abstract = {High-resolution information on climatic conditions is essential to many applications in environmental and ecological sciences. Here we present the CHELSA (Climatologies at high resolution for the earth’s land surface areas) data of downscaled model output temperature and precipitation estimates of the ERA-Interim climatic reanalysis to a high resolution of 30 arc sec. The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979–2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic forecasts of how species will respond to climate change are highly desired but difficult to achieve. Because processes at different scales are explicit in such models, careful assessments of their predictive abilities can provide valuable insights that will be relevant to functionally similar species. However, there are surprisingly few comprehensive field tests of mechanistic niche models in the literature. We applied a general, thermodynamically grounded modeling framework to determine the fundamental niche of an extremely well-studied herbivorous ectotherm, the sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa. We then compared the model predictions with detailed long-term field observations that included sub-hourly data on microclimate, activity levels, home ranges, and body temperatures as well as annual to decadal patterns of body condition and growth. Body temperature predictions inferred from gridded climatic data were within 10\% of empirically observed values and explained {\textgreater}70\% of observed daytime activity patterns across all lizards. However, some periods of activity restriction were explained by predicted desiccation level rather than by temperature, and metabolically driven activity requirements were much lower than potential activity time. Decadal trajectories of field growth and body condition could also be explained to within 10\% of observed values, with the variance in trajectories being attributable to whether individuals had access to permanent water. Continent-wide applications of the model partly captured the inland distribution limit, but only after accounting for water limitations. Predicted changes in habitat suitability under six climate change scenarios were generally positive within the species’ current range, but varied strongly with predicted rainfall. Temperature is regarded as the major factor that will restrict the distribution and abundance of lizards and other terrestrial ectotherms under climate change. Yet our findings show how water can be more important than temperature in constraining the activity, habitat requirements, and distribution limits of terrestrial ectotherms. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of first-principles computation of the climatic limits on terrestrial animals from gridded environmental data, providing a coherent picture for how species will respond to climate change at different scales of space and time.},

	abstract = {(1) I studied seasonal patterns of diurnal retreat-site selection by a nocturnal, rock-dwelling lizard Christinus marmoratus, as well as the way physical characteristics of potential retreat-sites affect the thermal conditions within them. (2) Lizards were selective of the diameter and degree of shading of rocky retreat-sites, and these two variables significantly influenced the thermal conditions beneath rocks. Rock thickness also exerted a strong influence on thermal conditions but lizards were not strongly selective of this characteristic. (3) Seasonal changes in the pattern of retreat-site selection, and in thermal conditions within retreat-sites, strongly suggest that temperature affected quantitative changes in the types of rocky retreat-sites used by the lizards. A significant seasonal shift in the qualitative nature of retreat-sites used by lizards, from rocks during spring to deep crevices in the bedrock during summer, also appears to be thermally driven.},
